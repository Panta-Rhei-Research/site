plain_language_summary: "The Construction Spine is the program's 10-step build of reality: kernel → core math → self-enrichment → physical carrier → physical grammar → measurement bridges → life → reflection → self-host → ontic closure. Each step makes a different *kind* of claim, so each step needs a different *kind* of inspection. This page maps every step to the verification modes that apply — formal proof for steps 1–3, bridge verification for steps 4–6, empirical prediction + falsification for measurement-bearing steps, and answer-shape scrutiny for the closure-level steps. Outside reviewers can use this map to find their entry point: 'I'm a category theorist — start me at step 3' or 'I'm an empirical physicist — show me steps 6 and 8.'"

> How each step of the Corpus Construction Spine can be inspected, checked, or challenged.

## Why construction-step verification matters

The Corpus shows how the structure was built. Verify shows how each construction step can be inspected. This is where the aligned spine becomes explicit:

Agenda -> Corpus -> Results -> Verify

Obligation -> Construction -> Consequence -> Inspection

## Construction steps inside the verification matrix

{% capture construction_verify_plate_caption %}Construction-step verification is one part of the broader verification matrix: each step must identify what it builds, what supports it, and which formal, bridge, empirical, or external checks apply.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-06-verification-matrix" variant="thumb" class="scientific-plate--compact" caption=construction_verify_plate_caption loading="lazy" %}

Construction-step verification asks what each step builds, what supports it, and which formal, bridge, empirical, or external checks apply.

## End-to-end verification view

The ten construction steps are not isolated inspection targets. They form one verification chain.

Each step inherits what earlier steps have earned and hands forward what later steps need:

1. **Build the τ-Kernel** — axiom inventory, primitive signature, trusted-base disclosure, kernel consistency, and foundational hinge review.
2. **Recover Core Mathematics** — formal proof checking, mathematical bridge verification, refusal discipline, and foundational hinge review.
3. **Internalize Self-Enrichment** — internal-logic checks, categorical consistency, semantic correspondence, and meta-language internalization.
4. **Identify Physical Carrier** — carrier identification, semantic adequacy, local/global gluing, and bridge plausibility.
5. **Internal Physical Grammar** — internal law-structure checks, dimensional consistency, observables, and physics bridge preparation.
6. **Measurement Bridges** — bridge verification, empirical accountability, prediction timing, falsification paths, and measurement calibration.
7. **Recover Life** — Core Semantics alignment for life, structural biology mapping, boundary/encoding/evolution checks, and scope discipline.
8. **Reflective Structure** — answer-shape checks, conceptual consistency, life/mind bridge verification, and meaning/value/normativity status.
9. **Self-Host Formal Systems** — meta-verification, object-theory hosting checks, proof-as-act analysis, and formal-system internalization.
10. **Test Ontic Closure** — no-externalities audit, substrate non-deferral, residual-boundary disclosure, proof/commitment boundary, and ontic-status burden.

The verification chain therefore runs from kernel integrity to mathematical bridge discipline, physical semantic adequacy, empirical falsification, life and reflective structure, self-hosting, and ontic-closure scrutiny.

  <li>
    Empirical checks:
    {% if empirical_checks.size > 0 %}
      {{ empirical_checks | join: "; " }}
    {% elsif step.sequence == 1 %}
      Not applicable at this step. Empirical accountability begins after internal physical grammar and measurement bridges are constructed.
    {% elsif step.sequence == 2 %}
      Not applicable as a direct empirical check. This step supports later empirical accountability by recovering mathematical capacity under kernel discipline.
    {% elsif step.sequence == 3 %}
      Not applicable as a direct empirical check. This step concerns internal logic, categorical structure, and semantic self-containment.
    {% elsif step.sequence == 4 or step.sequence == 5 %}
      Downstream of this step. Measurement, calibration, and falsification burdens begin once empirical bridge surfaces are constructed.
    {% elsif step.sequence == 8 %}
      Downstream or domain-dependent at this step. Reflective-structure claims require separate life, semantic, and metaphysical verification routes.
    {% elsif step.sequence == 9 or step.sequence == 10 %}
      Not the primary burden at this step. This step is assessed through meta-verification, no-externalities review, and explicit boundary disclosure.
    {% else %}
      Not applicable at this step.
    {% endif %}

    Unresolved frontiers:
