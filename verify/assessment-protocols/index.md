## What These Protocols Do

These protocols are designed for reviewers, readers, and external evaluators. They provide explicit checklists and prompts for structured scrutiny.

## Assessment inside the verification matrix

{% capture assessment_plate_caption %}Assessment Protocols are external-review routes inside the broader verification matrix. They help structure scrutiny, but they do not replace proof, empirical testing, or peer review.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-06-verification-matrix" variant="thumb" class="scientific-plate--compact" caption=assessment_plate_caption loading="lazy" %}

Assessment begins after the relevant obligation, construction step, result, and verification mode have been identified.

## Existing Detailed Library
