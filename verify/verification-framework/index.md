## What Verification Means Here

This program does not flatten verification into a single notion of proof. A Lean theorem, a bridge statement, a numerical prediction, a life-science explanation, and a metaphysical analysis do not carry the same evidential burden.

## Shared Verification Principles

- **Explicitness:** the claim and its scope must be named.
- **Traceability:** the reader should be able to move from result to Corpus support and, where available, TauLib support.
- **Consistency:** public pages, manifests, and generated artifacts should not silently disagree.
- **Derivability:** formal and mathematical claims must expose their derivation burden.
- **Inspectability:** critical artifacts should be public and stable enough to audit.
- **Accountability:** standards and failure modes must be stated before the result is defended.
- **Domain-appropriate validation:** physics, life, and metaphysics cannot be verified by proof syntax alone.
