## How the verification matrix becomes a route

{% capture how_to_verify_plate_caption %}How to Verify turns the verification matrix into reviewer entry routes: start from an obligation, construction step, result, TauLib surface, prediction, falsification path, or assessment protocol.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-06-verification-matrix" variant="thumb" class="scientific-plate--compact" caption=how_to_verify_plate_caption loading="lazy" %}

The matrix is not a single checklist. It is a routing layer that helps a reader choose which inspection mode fits the claim under review.

## Review routes

The former standalone reviewer kit has been folded into Verify and Engage.

Use this page to choose an inspection route. Use [Assessment Protocols]({{ '/verify/assessment-protocols/' | relative_url }}) for structured workflows. Use [Engage → Review the Work]({{ '/engage/review-the-work/' | relative_url }}) to offer bounded review, critique, correction, or contribution.

Review is a routed activity, not a standalone kit. Panta Rhei is inspected through bounded routes across Verify and Engage.

## Start with the inspection architecture

Before inspecting any individual claim, start with the inspection architecture.

Panta Rhei is organized so that reviewers can move from:

Program -> Agenda -> Corpus -> Results -> Verify

This means:

- first inspect the identity, status, and doctrine;
- then inspect the obligations;
- then inspect the construction;
- then inspect the current result stance;
- then inspect the verification route.

This route does not replace expert review. It orients bounded inspection.

## Choose Your Entry Route

<div class="v2-grid">
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/agenda/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>Start from Agenda</strong>
    <span>Check Core Semantics, the Problem Ledger, Kernel/Model/Reality burden, and the Construction Roadmap.</span>
  </a>
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/corpus/construction-spine/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>Start from the Construction Spine</strong>
    <span>Choose one of the ten construction steps and inspect Registry items, TauLib modules, book locations, related Results, and Verify surfaces.</span>
  </a>
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/browse/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>Start from a Result</strong>
    <span>Choose a result page, follow its agenda mapping, Corpus support, recovery target status, and verification route.</span>
  </a>
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>Start from TauLib</strong>
    <span>Inspect Lean formalization and map declarations back to Corpus items and construction steps.</span>
  </a>
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/verify/predictions-and-falsification/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>Start from Predictions / Falsification</strong>
    <span>Follow the Numerical Physics Ledger, prediction timing, falsification paths, and falsification packs.</span>
  </a>
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/verify/assessment-protocols/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>Start from Assessment Protocols</strong>
    <span>Use manual or LLM-assisted review routes.</span>

## Practical First Pass

1. Read [Scientific Rigor]({{ '/verify/scientific-rigor/' | relative_url }}) to understand the program's self-binding standards.
2. Use the [Verification Framework]({{ '/verify/verification-framework/' | relative_url }}) to identify the kind of verification your question needs.
3. If the question is construction-facing, use [Verify the Construction Spine]({{ '/verify/construction-spine-verification/' | relative_url }}) to map the relevant step to its inspection modes.
4. Inspect the operational surface: [TauLib]({{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}), [Release Manifest]({{ '/verify/release-manifest/' | relative_url }}), [Predictions & Falsification]({{ '/verify/predictions-and-falsification/' | relative_url }}), or [Assessment Protocols]({{ '/verify/assessment-protocols/' | relative_url }}).

## First-pass inspection checklist

1. Is the scope and burden of proof explicit?
2. Are the Problem Ledger and source-policy rules visible?
3. Are Core Semantics and answer-shape obligations stated separately from open problems?
4. Is there a Construction Roadmap / Construction Spine?
5. Is there a Corpus with stable IDs and dependency routes?
6. Is there a formalization surface, and are its limits stated?
7. Are Results status-marked?
8. Are bridge claims explicit?
9. Are falsification or failure paths visible?
10. Are errata and correction routes public?
11. Are remaining externalities disclosed?
12. Is there a route to ask questions or report errors?
