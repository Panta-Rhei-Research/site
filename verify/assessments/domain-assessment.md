## Expert-Domain Assessment

This prompt evaluates the Panta Rhei framework from the standpoint of a particular scientific or philosophical discipline. Use it when you want a specialist's-eye-view dossier --- for example, what a category theorist, particle physicist, or philosopher of mind would see when inspecting the public materials.

Choose a domain from the suggested list below (or specify your own), fill in the relevant site lane URLs, and copy the completed prompt into any frontier AI model --- Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or equivalent.


## Suggested Domains

The framework makes claims across several disciplines. The following domains are natural entry points for expert-domain assessment, listed with the most relevant site lanes and books.

| Domain | Primary Site Lane | Books |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Pure mathematics | [Mathematics Layer](https://panta-rhei.site/corpus/monographs/) | I, II |
| Category theory / topos theory | [Mathematics Layer](https://panta-rhei.site/corpus/monographs/) | I, II, III |
| Particle physics | [Physics Layer](https://panta-rhei.site/corpus/monographs/) | IV |
| Cosmology | [Physics Layer](https://panta-rhei.site/corpus/monographs/) | V |
| Philosophy of science | [Framework Overview](https://panta-rhei.site/corpus/) | I--VII |
| Philosophy of mind | [Metaphysics Layer](https://panta-rhei.site/corpus/monographs/) | VII |
| Formal methods / theorem proving | [TauLib Overview](https://panta-rhei.site/verify/taulib/) | I--VII |

Additional domains that may be relevant: condensed matter physics, mathematical physics, algebraic geometry, biological systems theory, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of biology, and scientific methodology.


## The Prompt

Fill in the template variables marked with `{% raw %}{{...}}{% endraw %}` below using the domain table above, then use the button to copy.

```text
You are assisting a domain specialist with a first-pass assessment of a public
research framework.

## Domain perspective
Review from the standpoint of: {{DOMAIN}}
Examples:
- pure mathematics
- category theory / topos theory
- formal methods / theorem proving
- particle physics
- cosmology
- philosophy of science
- philosophy of mind
- metaphysics

## Materials
- Domain-relevant site lane: {{DOMAIN_SITE_URL}}
- Relevant Guided Tour(s): {{DOMAIN_GUIDED_TOURS}}
- Relevant Lean companion(s): {{DOMAIN_LEAN_COMPANIONS}}
- TauLib repository: https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/taulib
- Optional relevant public talks / notes: {{OPTIONAL_PUBLIC_URLS}}

## Required task

Please answer:

### A. Domain fit
- Which parts of the framework most directly belong to this domain?
- Which parts should be ignored for this first-pass domain review?

### B. Domain seriousness
- Does the public material appear serious enough for a domain expert to inspect?
- Are the visible methods appropriate to the kinds of claims being made in this domain?
- What domain-specific evidence is present?
- What domain-specific evidence is missing?

### C. Domain novelty and overlap
- Which claims seem potentially novel in this domain?
- Which may risk rediscovery, relabeling, or overstatement?
- Which would require close prior-art comparison?

### D. Domain-specific attack surface
- What are the strongest domain-specific skeptical questions?
- What should a fair-minded expert test first?
- What visible weaknesses or gaps stand out from this domain's perspective?

### E. Domain-specific impact under three scenarios
1. If the domain-relevant claims hold
2. If some bridge claims fail but internal structure remains interesting
3. If the domain core fails but some methods / artifacts remain reusable

### F. Recommendation
Choose one:
- Ignore for now
- Worth limited specialist attention
- Worth serious domain review
- Worth urgent high-level domain attention

### G. Confidence typing
Use confidence labels for the quality of your assessment.

## Important rule
Do not pretend to have conclusively settled the domain questions.
Produce a serious first-pass domain dossier only.

Now produce the dossier.

## After Running the Prompt

Score the output using the [Three-Gate Rubric]({{ '/verify/assessments/three-gate-rubric/' | relative_url }}). Domain-level dossiers naturally weight certain criteria more heavily --- a category theory review will focus on Gate 1 (method visibility, claim typing) and Gate 2 (novelty signal, prior-art awareness), while a cosmology review will weight Gate 3 (impact magnitude, falsification readiness) more strongly. The rubric accommodates this by design: use the profile of scores, not the sum.
