## What This Page Catalogs

This page frames predictions as verification targets. The detailed current prediction catalogue remains in the Results lane, where each prediction is part of a result family and can be read with its domain context.

## Required Metadata for a Prediction Target

For each prediction surface, the program should expose:

- prediction ID
- related result ID
- related Corpus support
- domain
- type: structural, empirical, or hybrid
- current status
- linked falsification path where available

## Current Public Surfaces

- [Physics Predictions Browse]({{ '/results/predictions/browse/' | relative_url }})
- [Prediction Timing Ledger]({{ '/results/predictions/timing/' | relative_url }})
- [Fit-Space Argument]({{ '/results/predictions/fit-space-argument/' | relative_url }})
- [Falsification Pack]({{ '/results/falsifications/browse/' | relative_url }})
