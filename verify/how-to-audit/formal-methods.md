This route is written for a reviewer comfortable with proof assistants — Lean 4 and Mathlib preferred, but Coq/Agda/Isabelle users will recognize the pattern. The load-bearing question you should resolve first is: **does TauLib's claimed formalization state actually hold when you build it?**

Every other claim in the program depends on this. If TauLib compiles cleanly with the claimed `sorry` and `axiom` inventory, the framework has earned its internal-mathematical review-readiness. If it does not, most of the bridge claims fail regardless of their external-physics content.

## The 15-minute core check

```bash
# 1. Clone at the pinned commit
git clone https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/taulib
cd taulib
git checkout 2261c049119c8dd9a4e891457f196745178c02b3

# 2. Confirm toolchain pinning
cat lean-toolchain              # Expect: leanprover/lean4:v4.28.0-rc1
cat lake-manifest.json | head   # Expect: mathlib at commit 85028a6

# 3. Build
lake build                      # Expect: 0 errors, ~8–12 min on 8-core laptop

# 4. Audit sorry inventory
rg "^\s*sorry\s*$" TauLib --stats
# Expect: 0 matches across all 7 books

# 5. Audit custom axiom inventory
rg "^axiom " TauLib --stats
# Expect: 3 matches, all in TauLib/BookIII/

# 6. Per-module per-theorem axiom trace (spot check 3 headline theorems)
# In Lean 4 REPL or via a small script:
#   #print axioms Book2.CentralTheorem.centralTheorem        -- expect: only Mathlib axioms
#   #print axioms Book4.Generations.threeGenerationsTheorem  -- expect: only Mathlib axioms
#   #print axioms Book3.Spectrum.criticalLineTheorem         -- expect: 3 named axioms + Mathlib
```

If any of these six checks fail, the framework's formal-methods posture is not what it claims. The [Release Manifest]({{ '/verify/release-manifest/' | relative_url }}) is the authoritative snapshot you are verifying against.

## What to grep for next (30 minutes)

Once the core build succeeds, these are the highest-signal follow-up audits:

1. **Unused Mathlib imports.** The framework claims "tactics only — no Mathlib mathematical content." Audit imports:
   ```bash
   rg "^import Mathlib" TauLib --stats
   ```
   Check that only tactic-level Mathlib modules are imported (e.g., `Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith`, `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring`). Any `Mathlib.Analysis.*`, `Mathlib.Topology.*`, `Mathlib.NumberTheory.*` import would contradict the "no Mathlib content" claim.

2. **`@[instance]` and `@[simp]` attributes on core definitions.** Look for instance declarations that might be smuggling non-trivial content through typeclass resolution.
   ```bash
   rg "^@\[(instance|simp)\]" TauLib --stats
   ```

3. **`noncomputable` markers.** Count how many definitions are `noncomputable`. A kernel that claims constructivity should have few; a kernel that uses classical choice extensively will have many.

4. **Check-axioms discipline.** In Lean 4, `#print axioms X` reveals the full axiomatic dependency of any theorem. Spot-check **at least three** headline theorems from the registry's "formalized" entries and verify the axiom chain matches what the Release Manifest claims.

5. **Proof structure for core theorems.** Open `Book1/KernelCoherence.lean`, `Book2/CentralTheorem.lean`, and `Book4/Generations.lean` in an editor. Read the proofs. Do they appear to be genuine proofs with non-trivial content, or do they degenerate into `decide`, `trivial`, or `native_decide` tactics that would indicate missing proof content?

## The three headline theorems to read in source

If you have 60 minutes and want to understand the framework's formal-mathematical core, read these three Lean sources directly:

- **`Book1/Kernel.lean`** — the seven axioms K0–K6 and the categoricity + rigidity theorems. Load-bearing: if these theorems are trivial or circular in Lean, the entire framework is built on sand.
- **`Book2/CentralTheorem.lean`** — the ring isomorphism 𝒪(τ³) ≅ A_spec(𝕃). Load-bearing: this theorem is the bridge between the mathematical kernel (Book I) and the physics readout (Books IV–V). If it fails, the holography claim fails with it.
- **`Book3/CriticalLine.lean`** — the Critical Line Theorem III.T19, the τ-framework's spectral approach to RH. Load-bearing: this is the most load-bearing claim that sits in dense prior-art territory (Hilbert-Pólya, Connes). Specialist scrutiny of the proof structure is exactly the kind of check this route recommends.

## Fail-fast exits

Your audit is **done** (with a negative verdict) if any of the following is true:

- **Build fails.** `lake build` returns a non-zero exit code. The claimed 0-sorry state is inconsistent with the actual source.
- **Undeclared axioms appear in `#print axioms` output** on any theorem that registry marks "formalized". This contradicts the Release Manifest's axiom inventory claim.
- **Mathlib mathematical content is imported** (not just tactic modules). This contradicts the "no Mathlib content" architectural claim and means the "earned from seven axioms" story is not operationally clean.
- **Core kernel theorems have trivial or circular Lean proofs** (e.g., proving categoricity by declaring it as an axiom under a different name). The architectural claim of coherence-first derivation falls.

Any one of these is disqualifying.

Your audit is **positive** (the framework has passed the formal-methods gate) if:

- `lake build` is green at the pinned commit.
- `rg "sorry"` returns 0 matches across all 7 books (post `peer-review-fixes-v1`; the prior three Book VII methodological `sorry` declarations are now `def : Commitment` values).
- `rg "^axiom"` returns exactly 3 custom declarations, all in Book III and each documented in the TauLib browser.
- `#print axioms` on three randomly-chosen "formalized" registry entries returns only declared framework axioms plus standard Mathlib base axioms (`Classical.choice`, `propext`, `Quot.sound`) plus, where `native_decide` is used, the TCB extension (`Lean.ofReduceBool`, `Lean.trustCompiler`) disclosed on [TCB Disclosure]({{ '/verify/tcb/' | relative_url }}).
- The three headline theorems read as genuine mathematical content rather than definitional rearrangements.

A positive formal-methods audit does **not** establish the framework is correct about physics, life, or metaphysics. It establishes that the internal mathematical scaffolding is what the program claims it is. This is a necessary condition for the program to deserve further domain-level review; it is not a sufficient condition for accepting any bridge claim.

## What to escalate

If your audit is positive, the next domain-specific routes are:
- For claims in Books IV–V: [Physicist route]({{ '/verify/how-to-audit/physicist/' | relative_url }})
- For claims in Books VI–VII: [Philosopher route]({{ '/verify/how-to-audit/philosopher/' | relative_url }})
- For specialist-level claims: [Mathematician route]({{ '/verify/how-to-audit/mathematician/' | relative_url }}) and [Prior-Art Specialist route]({{ '/verify/how-to-audit/prior-art-specialist/' | relative_url }})

If your audit is negative, [contact the program]({{ '/engage/contact/' | relative_url }}) with the specific check that failed — this is the single most valuable feedback the project can receive.
