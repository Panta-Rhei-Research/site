expanded_rationale: "A physics-facing kernel must explain why physical quantities have stable roles before it can claim to recover laws, constants, or measurements. This item therefore tests whether the framework carries a typed measurement grammar rather than an untyped numerical fit."
public_summary: "Physical recovery begins with typed quantities: time, length, energy, charge, temperature, count, and luminosity cannot be treated as interchangeable labels."
what_this_requires:
  - "Stable semantic roles for time, length, mass/energy, charge/current, temperature, amount/count, and luminosity where required."
  - "A bridge from internal invariants to public measurement units without treating units as primitive ontology."
  - "Enough type discipline to prevent category mistakes between formal parameters, empirical observables, and calibration conventions."
what_this_does_not_claim:
  - "It does not claim that every conventional unit is ontically primitive."
  - "It does not claim that public measurement practice is already fully derived."
  - "It does not replace empirical calibration with formal notation."

# Physical Quantity Types

## Requirement

The kernel must recover meaningful physical quantity types rather than treating physics as dimensionless bookkeeping.

## What This Target Requires

- Stable semantic roles for time, length, mass/energy, charge/current, temperature, amount/count, and luminosity where required.

## Current Status

This v0.1 item fixes the public burden of proof. Detailed formal, empirical, or bridge verification remains routed through the Verify and Results lanes.
