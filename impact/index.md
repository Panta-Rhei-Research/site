## What this lane is

Impact is the conditional consequence layer of the site. It asks what might become relevant if specific Results survive verification, translation, and domain uptake.

Impact pages describe conditional consequence structures. They help readers understand possible implications without turning those implications into promises.

## What this lane is not

Impact is not a promise of social, scientific, technological, educational, existential, or institutional adoption.

It is not a product roadmap. It is not a deployment claim. It is not a claim that the framework has already transformed any domain.

Results and Verify remain upstream. Translation and domain uptake remain required before any impact claim becomes actionable.

## Impact is conditional

Impact is conditional: no consequence is stronger than the Results, verification status, translation assumptions, and domain uptake on which it depends.

## Important Note

The word **if** is load-bearing. Impact remains downstream of explicit assumptions, translation layers, and survival under scrutiny. For the publication index of these conditional scenario artifacts, see [Public-Good Briefings]({{ '/publications/research-briefings/public-good/' | relative_url }}).
