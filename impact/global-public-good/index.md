## What This Section Does

Global Public Good gathers conditional public-good portfolios. These are not promises that the framework will transform a domain. They are conditional consequence maps: if the relevant Results hold, and if they can be translated into domain-specific models, what public-good pathways become worth investigating?

## Deployment-status note

No portfolio on this page claims real-world adoption, policy implementation, external validation, or operational readiness. Every portfolio remains a scenario map until upstream Results survive verification, translation assumptions are tested, and domain uptake is possible.

## Relation to Public-Good Briefings

The portfolio pages organize public-good domains. [Public-Good Briefings]({{ '/publications/research-briefings/public-good/' | relative_url }}) are the publication artifacts attached to those domains.

## Portfolio Index

<div class="portfolio-grid">
{% for p in site.data.impact.portfolios %}
  <a href="{{ p.url | relative_url }}" class="portfolio-card">
    <h3 class="portfolio-card-title">{{ p.title }}</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-card-summary">{{ p.summary_short }}</p>
    <span class="chip chip-small">{{ p.briefing_count }} {% if p.briefing_count == 1 %}briefing{% else %}briefings{% endif %}</span>
  </a>
{% endfor %}
</div>

## Reading Discipline

Read every portfolio through the [Impact Framework]({{ '/impact/impact-framework/' | relative_url }}): Result → Verification survival → Translation layer → Domain uptake → Consequence.

If any upstream link weakens, the public-good claim weakens with it.
