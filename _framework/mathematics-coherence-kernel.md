## Overview

The Coherence Kernel is the foundation of everything that follows. It is a minimal formal specification — five constant symbols, one unary operator, and seven axioms — from which the entire mathematical, physical, biological, and metaphysical structure of Category τ is derived. Nothing is imported from outside. No set theory, no real numbers, no geometry, no logic is assumed as given. These must all be [earned]({{ '/framework/about/why-the-framework-begins-so-low/' | relative_url }}) from the kernel's own resources.

The specification is deliberately spare. Where Peano Arithmetic begins with one constant and one successor, and ZFC begins with one binary relation, Category τ begins with five constants (α, π, γ, η, ω), one unary function ρ (progression), and one binary relation < (strict order). The total vocabulary is seven symbols. This is the entire primitive language of the theory.

## The Core Idea

The five generators are arranged in a strict total order: α < π < γ < η < ω. Four of them (α, π, γ, η) seed infinite orbit rays when the progression operator ρ is iterated. The fifth, ω, is the fixed point of ρ — the closure beacon that bounds the universe from above.

Seven axioms govern this structure:

- **K0 (Universe Postulate)**: The totality τ exists as a universe of discourse distinct from ω.
- **K1 (Strict Order)**: The five generators satisfy α < π < γ < η < ω.
- **K2 (Fixed Point)**: ω is the unique fixed point of ρ — it is unmoved by progression.
- **K3 (Orbit-Seeded Generation)**: Each non-ω generator seeds an infinite orbit ray under iterated ρ.
- **K4 (No-Jump Cover)**: Within each orbit, ρ(x) is the immediate successor — no elements are skipped.
- **K5 (Unreachability of ω)**: ω cannot be reached from below by any finite iteration of ρ.
- **K6 (Object Closure)**: The five orbits and the beacon {ω} exhaust the universe — there are no other objects.

Together, these define the *static kernel* τ₀: a finite, complete specification that is precise, categorical, and inert. No objects have been created yet; no arithmetic has been earned. That is the work of the [modules that follow]({{ '/framework/mathematics-orbit-generation/' | relative_url }}).

## Why This Matters

The number five is not arbitrary. The [diagonal discipline]({{ '/publications/books/book-i/' | relative_url }}) (Part I, Chapter 5) shows that exactly four orbit channels — and no more — can carry independent structural information without violating the cover relation. A fifth orbit would require a diagonal reuse that the kernel forbids. This is why the framework has five generators and not four, six, or infinitely many.

This constraint is what makes the later derivations non-trivial. When the framework later derives [arithmetic]({{ '/framework/mathematics-earning-arithmetic/' | relative_url }}), geometry, analysis, and physics from these five generators, it does so without hidden free parameters — because the kernel leaves no room for them.

## Key Claims

1. **I.D01** — Five generators defined (α, π, γ, η, ω) with strict total order *(established)*
2. **I.K0–K6** — Seven axioms specifying the complete kernel *(established)*
3. **I.P01** — Generator distinctness: all five are pairwise distinct *(established, machine-checked in [TauLib]({{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}))*
4. The number of generators (five) is structurally forced by the diagonal discipline *(tau-effective)*
