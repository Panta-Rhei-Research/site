The program binds itself to strong constraints. Every mathematical tool is *earned* from five generators, seven axioms, and one operator — not imported from existing mathematics. Every scope claim carries an explicit label: established, tau-effective, conjectural, or metaphorical. Every derivation chain is machine-checked in Lean 4.

The stronger the claimed scope, the stricter the foundation must be. This is not a design choice — it is a structural necessity. A framework that claims to derive both the Higgs mass and the Categorical Imperative from the same kernel must be maximally constrained, or it is merely telling stories.

Category tau begins below ordinary category theory. Five generators (alpha, pi, gamma, eta, omega) in strict total order, one progression operator (rho), and seven axioms (K0-K6) define a complete, rigid, countable universe. From this kernel, the framework earns its own arithmetic, geometry, analysis, topology, and category theory — then enriches itself through four layers:

- **E0 — Mathematics** (Books I-III): Kernel, holomorphy, spectral structure
- **E1 — Physics** (Books IV-V): Microcosm and macrocosm from one constant
- **E2 — Life** (Book VI): Life as self-decoding distinctions
- **E3 — Metaphysics** (Book VII): The final self-enrichment

The master constant iota_tau = 2/(pi+e) governs all quantitative predictions. Zero free parameters.

The program currently presents **{{ result_count }} key results** across four domains, each with typed epistemic status. A small selection of flagship claims:

- **Dark sector closure** [Resolved] — dark matter and dark energy as structural artifacts of the boundary reading, not new particles
- **Hubble tension** [Resolved] — h = 2/3 + iota_tau^2/17 at -120 ppm, zero free parameters
- **Genetic code optimality** [Resolved] — top 0.01% for error minimization, derived from BSD-motivic structure
- **Categorical Imperative** [Resolved] — Kant's CI derived as the unique j-closed fixed point, not postulated
- **Hierarchy problem** [Resolved] — the 10^32 gravity/EM ratio from structural sector separation
- **Gettier Problem** [Resolved] — knowledge as global section, Gettier cases as cover failures

Every claim carries a status: resolved, partial, qualitative, or contradicted. The typing is not optional — it is the program's principal epistemic commitment.

This is not a program that asks for trust. It is a program that provides inspection routes:

- **{{ book_count }} canonical books** — {{ chapter_count }} chapters in proof-order, available on Amazon KDP
- **TauLib** — 450 Lean 4 modules, 125,771 lines, 4,332 machine-checked theorems, 0 sorry in Books I-VI
- **{{ registry_count }} registry objects** — every definition, theorem, and proposition with dependency graphs
- **8 guided tours** — interactive Lean walkthroughs for skeptics, mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and philosophers
- **220+ quantitative predictions** — specific numerical values with explicit precision and falsification routes (a subset of the {{ result_count }} total results)

The decisive empirical test: CMB-S4 will measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio *r*. If *r* is inconsistent with iota_tau^4, the framework's cosmological predictions fail.

If the framework holds — or partially holds — consequences could propagate into public-good domains. The program's impact lane explores 11 conditional deployment portfolios grounded in 44 companion papers:

- **Climate and weather** — causal-tree legibility for mitigation, adaptation, and resilience planning
- **Energy** — grid optimization, fusion digital twins, renewable integration
- **Life sciences** — precision agriculture, public health, biodiversity monitoring
- **Ocean and water** — marine ecosystem modeling, water security, coastal resilience

The word *if* is load-bearing. These are scenario analyses, not predictions of social adoption. The framework must survive empirical testing before any downstream consequence becomes real. The program is independent research — not yet peer-reviewed in traditional journals. All claims carry explicit scope labels.

- **[Verify]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }})** — clone TauLib, run `lake build`, step through the tours
- **[Media Kit]({{ '/media/' | relative_url }})** — for journalists, podcast hosts, reviewers, and institutions
- **[Follow the Research]({{ '/engage/follow-the-research/' | relative_url }})** — stay connected with the program's ongoing work
