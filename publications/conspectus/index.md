The **Panta Rhei Conspectus** is a self-contained, single-sitting reading of the seven-book Panta Rhei series — the briefest possible document that still carries the full narrative and structural arc of the research programme. It is designed to be consumed in one go (reading time approximately **35–45 minutes**), without requiring the reader to leave the document or consult the monograph first.

> **Trust-budget note.** The downloadable v1.1 PDF still contains the pre-refactor TauLib trust-budget disclosure. The current pinned TauLib release state is **3 custom axioms, 0 sorry**, with Book VII methodological commitments represented as inspectable `def : Commitment` values. The [Release Manifest]({{ '/verify/release-manifest/' | relative_url }}) is authoritative for current machine-checkable counts.

The name comes from Latin *conspicere*, "to survey with the eyes, to take in at a glance" — a scholarly genre for giving a comprehensive view-of-the-whole of a body of work. The Conspectus is distinct from the brief *Series Prospectus* (23 pp, marketing-facing) and the deep *Numerical Physics Ledger* (209 pp, numerical audit trail): it sits between, as the canonical narrative synthesis.

## What the Conspectus covers

Five parts, seventeen sections, one integrated argument:

**Part I — The Problem and the Posit.** Where mathematical foundations (ZFC as an armistice, not a solution) and physical foundations (19 free parameters, unreconciled pillars) stand today, and the structural root they share: objects-before-relations. Then the Panta Rhei posit: Category τ specified by **7 axioms (K0–K6) on 5 generators {α, π, γ, η, ω}**, the master constant **ι<sub>τ</sub> = 2/(π+e)**, and the **L0 → L4 calibration cascade** from algebra through dimensionless identities through the single SI anchor (neutron mass *m<sub>n</sub>*) to SI-bearing readouts and experimental programmes.

**Part II — The Seven Books as One Argument.** Each book gets approximately two pages, cascade-aware:

- **Book I — Categorical Foundations.** Label-independence and internal reconstruction. Arithmetic, sets, geometry from the kernel. ι<sub>τ</sub> as the unique closing value.
- **Book II — Categorical Holomorphy.** The fibration τ³ = τ¹ ×<sub>f</sub> T² with lemniscate boundary 𝕃 = S¹ ∨ S¹. The Central Theorem 𝒪(τ³) ≅ 𝔸<sub>spec</sub>(𝕃) — bulk from boundary.
- **Book III — Categorical Spectrum.** The (×, ∧) primordial tension; the universal operator H<sub>∞</sub> = ι<sub>τ</sub>²·Δ<sub>Hodge</sub>; seven Millennium Problems and Langlands as spectral fronts of one operator.
- **Book IV — Categorical Microcosm.** Quantum mechanics as Hodge theory on T². Three generations from topology. The L1 cascade: α = (121/225)·ι<sub>τ</sub>⁴, m<sub>p</sub>/m<sub>e</sub> closing identity, Weinberg angle NLO.
- **Book V — Categorical Macrocosm.** Gravity and cosmology from the base τ¹. The *m<sub>n</sub>* anchor consumed. The L3 SI-rescaling functor. No dark-sector postulates: *r* = ι<sub>τ</sub>⁴, Hubble readout −120 ppm.
- **Book VI — Categorical Life.** Life as stable self-decoding endomorphisms of τ³. Seven hallmarks from categorical closure. Black holes as candidate exemplars; Omega Point as limiting ideal.
- **Book VII — Categorical Metaphysics.** Four registers (empirical / practical / diagrammatic / logos). Consciousness as global section of the mind sheaf. Meaning as τ³ ≅ τ³ — structure recognising itself.

**Part III — What the Programme Commits To.** The three commitment documents together:

- **The Numerical Physics Ledger at a glance.** 67 zero-parameter dimensionless predictions; precision tiers (A ~0.025 ppm, B ~3 ppm, C ~0.8%); the Calibration Sufficiency Theorem.
- **The Falsification Pack N1–N30.** 30 named experiments on a 2025–2035 timeline; 4 confirmed, 26 consistent-and-testable; three framework-terminal scenarios named. Flagship: N9 at CMB-S4 (~14σ on the 2028–2032 window).
- **TauLib — the formal trust budget.** ~4,332 theorems across 445 modules, 3 conjecture-axioms, **0 sorry**. CI enforces tactics-only Mathlib and the axiom/sorry counts. `native_decide` TCB extensions are disclosed on the [TCB page]({{ '/verify/tcb/' | relative_url }}).

**Part IV — The Programme in a Single Image.** A master-cascade diagram (L0 → L4 horizontal × E₀ → E₃ vertical, with the Omega Point dashed loop) and a single master table comparing τ-predicted vs CODATA 2018 / PDG measured for every major dimensionless constant and every structural binary prediction.

**Part V — How to Verify and How to Engage.** Four verification routes: read the Numerical Physics Ledger, clone and build TauLib, browse the registry, work the falsification checklist. Engagement ladder from Series Prospectus through the seven books to the Lean formalization.

**Closing reflection.** Heraclitus bookend: *structure recognising structure; everything flows*.

## Who this is for

The Conspectus is deliberately scholar-first but addresses a **generalist scholarly audience**. The seven books span mathematical foundations, spectral theory, quantum mechanics, particle physics, cosmology, theoretical biology, philosophy of mind, and categorical metaphysics — no single reader is a specialist across that range. The Conspectus treats the reader as an expert in something and a careful generalist elsewhere, and calibrates its density accordingly.

## Scope labels

Every quantitative statement in the Conspectus carries one of four scope labels:

- **Established** — classical, independently confirmed
- **τ-effective** — derived inside the programme on the calibration cascade
- **Conjectural** — structural claim, not yet fully derived
- **Metaphorical** — philosophical or analogical, not formally a theorem

See the [Verify lane]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}) for the full scope-label discipline.

## Version history and peer-review retrospective

**v1.1 (April 21, 2026) — post-panel revision.** A four-reviewer + chair pre-publication peer-review panel was run on v1.0 (Opus-4.6 frontier-expert reviewers across mathematical foundations, physics / calibration, expository rigor, adversarial skeptic). The panel returned MAJOR_REVISIONS_REQUIRED, anchored by an arithmetic audit that identified drift between v1.0's numerical claims and Book IV's canonical text. The v1.1 revision applied the chair's Tier-1 punch list:

- **Numerical flagships re-labeled and re-tiered:** `R = ι_τ⁻⁷ − √3·ι_τ⁻²` is `m_n/m_e` (neutron/electron, not m_p/m_e) at +7.7 ppm (leading order); `α = (121/225)·ι_τ⁴` at −9.8 ppm; `r = ι_τ⁴ = 0.01357`; `n_s = 1 − 2/57` at +13 ppm; `Q = 2/3` exact. Residuals are stated per row rather than aggregated into a single tier slogan.
- **Category τ semantics pinned** as the syntactic category `Syn(T_τ)` / classifying topos `Set[T_τ]`.
- **Categoricity Theorem rewritten** as an *initial-model* claim (survives Löwenheim–Skolem honestly).
- **Fit-space objection engaged** directly, with pointer to the programme's fit-space calculation.
- **Discrete-choice budget disclosed** (rational prefactors, window-sum indices, exponent library).
- **Sector Exhaustion Theorem (V.T44) stated informally** rather than named-but-invisible.
- **Lean trust budget made honest and then updated to the pinned TauLib release:** v1.1 disclosed the pre-refactor TauLib trust budget rather than preserving an aspirational count. The pinned public TauLib release has since landed the peer-review refactor: **3 custom axioms, 0 sorry**, and inspectable Book VII `Commitment` values. The [Release Manifest]({{ '/verify/release-manifest/' | relative_url }}) is authoritative for the current machine-checkable trust budget.
- **Hubble readout reframed** as orbit-depth-dependent, per Book V Chapter 45.
- **"Four confirmed" renamed "Four pre-conditions met at current sensitivity"** with explicit "also predicted by" column — none of N5, N7, N16, N27 yet *discriminates* τ from the Standard Model / ΛCDM.
- **Master-cascade figure re-laid** to eliminate label truncation and Omega Point overlap.

The v1.0 document has been superseded; v1.1 is the canonical release.

**v1.0 (April 20, 2026).** Initial release. Withdrawn in favor of v1.1 after peer-review panel.
