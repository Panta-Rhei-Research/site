## Research Monographs

Research Monographs are the full book-length canonical release artifacts of the Panta Rhei Research Program. This Publications page is the citation, DOI, format, and artifact-status surface.

For the open Book → Part → Chapter reading projection, use [Corpus Monographs]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}). Corpus is where the monograph exposition participates in the constructed research body; Publications is where the same books are stabilized as released artifacts.

<div class="notice note"><strong>Category boundary.</strong> Research Monographs are the main canonical volumes. Omitted chapters, ledgers, appendices, and book-style supporting parts released separately belong under Monograph Supplements.</div>
