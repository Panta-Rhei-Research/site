## Publication Ontology

The Panta Rhei Research Program publishes through complementary surfaces rather than a single monolithic release. This is deliberate: a research program that claims to bridge mathematics, physics, biology, and metaphysics needs multiple entry points — the canonical proof-order argument (the books), the structured falsification surface (the white papers), the machine-checked [verification layer]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}), and the domain-specific guided tours that lower the threshold for expert engagement. Each surface serves a different kind of reader and a different depth of scrutiny. Publications are not marketing — they are the canonical articulation of the research, designed so that the [framework's claims]({{ '/framework/about/' | relative_url }}) can be inspected from any angle.

## Publication Families

### [The Seven Books]({{ '/publications/books/' | relative_url }})

The canonical monograph series — organized in proof-order, 79 parts, 535 chapters, ~3,430 pages. Each book earns its content from what came before.

{% for book in site.data.publications.books %}
- **Book {{ book.roman }}**: [{{ book.title }}]({{ book.url | relative_url }}) — *{{ book.subtitle }}* ({{ book.pages }} pages)
{% endfor %}

### [Guided Tours]({{ '/publications/guided-tours/' | relative_url }})

Structural falsification whitepapers (56 pages, 49 hinges), Lean verification companions, and 8 interactive TauLib tours for different audiences.

### [White Papers]({{ '/publications/white-papers/' | relative_url }})

Technical documents: falsification pack (220+ predictions), Lean verification report, reviewer's dossier, reader's guide, series prospectus, and seminar abstracts.

### [Companion Papers]({{ '/publications/companion-papers/' | relative_url }})

44 public-good deployment papers across 11 impact portfolios — conditional scenario analyses. Full text available in the [Impact lane]({{ '/impact/' | relative_url }}).

### [Assessment Protocols]({{ '/verify/assessments/' | relative_url }})

AI-assisted first-pass assessment protocol with three-gate rubric, prompt templates, and structured dossier output. Now part of the [Verify lane]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}).

### [Archived Releases — First Edition]({{ '/publications/archived/first-edition/' | relative_url }})

The First Edition (December 2025) is preserved as an archived historical release. It documents an earlier public state of the work before the current canonical Second Edition. It remains available for reference and comparison, but it is no longer the active research canon.

## How Publications Relate to the Site

The books carry the canonical argument in proof-order — each chapter depends on what came before, and the seven volumes form a single derivation chain from [kernel]({{ '/framework/about/what-the-tau-framework-is/' | relative_url }}) to [metaphysics]({{ '/publications/books/book-vii/' | relative_url }}). The Atlas (this site) provides navigable access in understanding-order — readers can enter through any lane and follow the path that matches their questions. [TauLib]({{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}) provides machine-checked verification. The guided tours and companion papers lower the threshold for structured engagement.

These are not separate projects. They are different public surfaces of the same research program. The [Results lane]({{ '/results/' | relative_url }}) provides the claims; the books provide the proofs; the [bibliography]({{ '/bibliography/' | relative_url }}) provides the scholarly context; and the [verification surfaces]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}) provide the routes for inspection.
