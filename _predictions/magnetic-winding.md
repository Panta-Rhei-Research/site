## τ-Formula

**w = dim(T²) = 2**

## Derivation

The Faraday rotation measure (RM)
around the shadow of a $T^2$ black hole
exhibits winding number

The toroidal magnetic field
on the minor $S^1$ cycle
causes two sign changes per azimuthal circuit,
compared to one for a radial/dipolar field on $S^2$.
The winding number $2$
is a topological invariant
of genus$(T^2) = 1$.

The toroidal B-field wraps around the minor $S^1$
(Definition (def:ch42-toroidal-bfield),
Chapter (ch:book5-ch42-eht-reread)).
As the line of sight traces one azimuthal circuit
around the shadow,
it crosses two sectors
where the toroidal field component $B_$
reverses sign:
once at the ``top'' of the torus
and once at the ``bottom.''
Each reversal produces a sign change in the RM integral
$RM = n_e \,B_ \,dl$.
For $S^2$ with a radial or dipolar field,
only one sign change occurs per circuit.
The winding number is
$w_RM = |number of sign changes|/1 = 2$
for $T^2$ and $1$ for $S^2$.

The Stokes $V$ circular polarization winding number
around the shadow is
