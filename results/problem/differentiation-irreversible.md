## Overview

VI.T47 proves that cellular differentiation is irreversible in the τ-framework. The Waddington descent function W(c) for a cell c is the categorical depth of c in the SelfDesc tower — equivalently, its developmental commitment level. W(c) is a monotone: dW/dt ≤ 0. Once a cell descends toward greater differentiation (W decreases), it cannot reverse. The result is a mathematical proof of Waddington's epigenetic landscape intuition.

## Detail

Waddington's epigenetic landscape is a visual metaphor for cell differentiation: pluripotent stem cells roll downhill through valleys toward differentiated states, and cannot roll back uphill. It is a metaphor — there is no mathematical theorem behind it. Book VI provides the theorem. The Waddington descent function W(c) for a cell c is defined as the categorical depth of c: how many levels of SelfDesc-tower descent c has undergone. A stem cell is at W = 0 (top of the tower); a fully differentiated terminal cell is at W = W_max. VI.T47 proves that the dynamical evolution of c satisfies dW/dt ≤ 0: W is non-increasing. The proof uses the irreversibility of the ρ-orbit at E₂ (analogous to V.P03 for E₁): once a cell descends to a deeper SelfDesc level, the categorical morphisms that effected the descent are non-invertible, so no process can reverse them without violating the E₂ sector coherence conditions. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a partial violation of this in the laboratory — VI.T47 implies that iPSC reprogramming must bypass the normal τ-dynamics, consistent with the finding that Yamanaka reprogramming requires overriding multiple developmental signals.

## Result Statement

VI.T47: The Waddington descent function W(c) is a monotone dW/dt ≤ 0 — differentiation is irreversible from categorical principles.
