## Overview

The Hodge Conjecture (one of the seven Clay Millennium Problems) asks whether every Hodge class on a smooth projective algebraic variety is a rational linear combination of classes of algebraic cycles. The <math><mi>&tau;</mi></math>-framework addresses this through the [spectral algebra]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) and the ABCD grading of cohomology classes.

## Detail

The [4+1 sector template]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) at <math><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math> decomposes the cohomology of <math><msup><mi>&tau;</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></math> into ABCD-graded components. The Hodge decomposition corresponds to the bipolar spectral decomposition via the [lemniscate]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) characters <math><msub><mi>&chi;</mi><mo>+</mo></msub></math> and <math><msub><mi>&chi;</mi><mo>&minus;</mo></msub></math>. The tau-effective statement is that Hodge classes correspond to spectral components with specific polarity signatures in the B/C classifier (III.D23). The structural framework is in place -- the [Master Schema]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) frames the Hodge Conjecture as an instance of the Eternal Force -- but the full proof chain from spectral polarity to algebraic representability remains incomplete.

## Result Statement

Hodge Conjecture: ABCD spectral grading provides the structural approach; polarity-to-algebraicity bridge is incomplete. Status: **Partial** *(tau-effective for spectral framework; conjectural for the full proof)*.

   internal="The NF-Addressability Theorem (III.T28) and the ABCD-graded spectral decomposition of cohomology of τ³ establish that Hodge classes correspond to spectral components with specific polarity signatures in the B/C classifier (III.D23). Within the τ-framework's own setting, the Hodge statement is addressable through this structural lens."
   bridge="The identification of τ-framework spectral components with orthodox algebraic cycles on smooth projective varieties is not a theorem. The polarity-to-algebraicity bridge is the gap: τ-spectral polarity signatures need to be identified with rational linear combinations of algebraic-cycle classes in the classical Hodge-decomposition sense."
   to_close="A proof that τ-spectral classes with B/C-polarity signatures correspond faithfully to algebraic cycle classes on the underlying complex projective variety would complete the Hodge-Conjecture bridge."
