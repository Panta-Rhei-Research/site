## Overview

P vs NP asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly can also be *solved* quickly. It is one of the seven Clay Millennium Problems. The framework provides a structural reading through the [Computation Bridge]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}): witness search is address account in the [ABCD chart]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}), and the [Interface Width Principle]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) (III.T31) constrains the complexity.

## Detail

The <math><mi>&tau;</mi></math>-Tower Machine (III.T30) models computation with bounded multiplicity. The question becomes whether <math><mi>&tau;</mi></math>-admissible collapse (addressing a multi-address query to canonical form) can always be done in polynomial time. The answer depends on the Segre branching structure (III.T34) of the split-complex holomorphic mapping. The framework provides a structural interpretation but does not yet prove P <math><mo>&ne;</mo></math> NP — hence the Partial status. The tau-effective statement reduces to verification at primorial levels.

## Result Statement

Structural reading via tau-Tower Machine and Interface Width Principle. The full P <math><mo>&ne;</mo></math> NP proof remains open. Status: **Partial** *(tau-effective — structural framework established, orthodox bridge conjectural)*.

   internal="The τ-Tower Machine (III.T30) and Interface Width Principle (III.T31) provide a structural model of τ-admissible computation in which τ-P_adm = τ-NP_adm at E₂. Within this computational substrate, the collapse is a theorem."
   bridge="The classical P vs NP separation concerns Turing-machine computation, not τ-admissible computation. The τ-Tower Machine is an E₂-native model, and its relation to Turing machines is not an identity — there is no claim that τ-collapse implies classical P = NP, and the scope gap is explicitly acknowledged."
   to_close="A proof that the τ-Tower Machine is polynomially equivalent to a Turing machine under a specific translation would bridge the τ-collapse to the classical question. Without such a bridge, the two formulations remain genuinely different questions that share a name."
