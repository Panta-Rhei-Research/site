## Overview

The Hyperfactorization Theorem (I.T04) is the first hinge theorem of the entire series. It proves that the [ABCD Coordinate Chart]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) is injective: every object in Category <math><mi>&tau;</mi></math> has a *unique* four-dimensional address. Without this result, the coordinate system would be ambiguous and all subsequent structural claims would collapse.

## Detail

Three lemmas support the theorem: tetration injectivity, the No-Tie Lemma (I.L03, ensuring the greedy peel is deterministic), and Strict Remainder Descent (I.L04, ensuring termination). The consequence is that shadow equality collapses to ontic identity -- distinct objects always have distinct addresses. See the [full derivation]({{ '/results/problem/hyperfactorization-theorem/' | relative_url }}) and the [Hyperfactorization module]({{ '/corpus/monographs/' | relative_url }}) for the complete proof structure.

## Result Statement

Every object has a unique ABCD decomposition. Status: **Internally addressed** *(established, machine-checked in [TauLib]({{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}))*.
