## What makes a result a landmark

A Landmark Result is not a trophy case and not a claim of external settlement. It is a result whose interpretive force is unusually high inside the program: if the result holds, the reader has to redraw the map of what the framework is doing.

The selection is intentionally editorial. It is not balanced sampling, not completion accounting, and not a proxy for peer review. The full Results lane remains the ledger; this page is the guided route through the results that most strongly change the shape of the picture.

<div class="notice note"><strong>Status note.</strong> Landmark status marks internal program significance. Every item below must still be read through its result status, verification route, and external-review boundary.</div>

{% capture landmark_plate_caption %}Landmark Results are the consequences with the strongest map-changing force inside the program. They remain status-marked internal results unless and until their formal, bridge, empirical, and external review conditions are met.{% endcapture %}

## A small kernel, many consequences

The first landmark is the kernel itself: [the τ-coherence kernel]({{ '/results/problem/tau-kernel-coherence/' | relative_url }}) claims that the program is not starting from a large catalogue of assumptions, but from a small generator and axiom base. The [Central Theorem]({{ '/results/problem/central-theorem/' | relative_url }}) then carries that base into a spectral bridge, while the [Canonical Ladder]({{ '/results/problem/canonical-ladder-theorem/' | relative_url }}) turns domain expansion into staged construction rather than thematic analogy.

That is why the [Four-Layer Architecture of Reality]({{ '/results/problem/the-four-layer-architecture-of-reality/' | relative_url }}) belongs here. It is the point where a mathematical spine becomes a world-facing architecture: mathematics, physics, life, and reflective/metaphysical structure are read as consequence surfaces of one built Corpus.

## The physics shock

The physics landmarks are not presented as external validation. They are presented as the places where the framework becomes most exposed to measurement, numerical precision, and falsification. The [electron-mass derivation]({{ '/results/problem/electron-mass-0025-ppm/' | relative_url }}) is the sharpest numerical pressure point; [the dark-sector closure result]({{ '/results/problem/no-dark-matter-particle/' | relative_url }}) reframes the dark-matter search; and the [vacuum-catastrophe account]({{ '/results/problem/vacuum-catastrophe-resolution/' | relative_url }}) asks whether a scale mismatch can be read through the Corpus instead of patched around it.

The same arc continues through the [Hubble-tension result]({{ '/results/problem/hubble-tension/' | relative_url }}), the [neutrino-mass sum]({{ '/results/problem/neutrino-mass-sum-0pt089-ev-normal-ordering/' | relative_url }}), the question of [why matter has three generations]({{ '/results/problem/why-three-generations/' | relative_url }}), and the forward-facing [primordial gravitational waves]({{ '/results/problem/primordial-gravitational-waves/' | relative_url }}) surface. These are landmarks because they force the program into contact with precision, bridge adequacy, and empirical accountability.

## Life stops being a side case

The life-facing landmarks ask whether life is an accidental late add-on or a structural consequence of the same construction. The page [What is Life?]({{ '/results/problem/what-is-life/' | relative_url }}) sets the definitional burden. The [abiogenesis timescale bound]({{ '/results/problem/abiogenesis-timescale-bound/' | relative_url }}) and [homochirality derivation]({{ '/results/problem/homochirality-universality-12-step-derivation/' | relative_url }}) then make that burden concrete: timing, handedness, and biochemical asymmetry become places where the framework has to earn its claims.

The most worldview-changing formulation is [Life as Structurally Favored Rather Than Accidental]({{ '/results/problem/life-as-structurally-favored-rather-than-accidental/' | relative_url }}). Its current status remains qualitative, but the direction is unmistakably landmark-like: life is no longer merely appended to physics; it becomes a test of whether the construction really has life-facing consequence.

## Mind, meaning, and normativity as result surfaces

The final landmarks are the most philosophically volatile. [Why Something Rather Than Nothing]({{ '/results/problem/why-something-rather-than-nothing/' | relative_url }}) asks whether existence can be treated as an inspectable burden rather than a hidden premise. The [Hard Problem of Consciousness]({{ '/results/problem/hard-problem-of-consciousness/' | relative_url }}) is included precisely because its status is partial: it marks the boundary between structural explanation and remaining phenomenological burden.

The [Categorical Imperative Derivation]({{ '/results/problem/categorical-imperative-derivation/' | relative_url }}) is the normativity landmark. If it survives scrutiny, the ethical surface is not imported as a private preference; it is treated as a structural consequence that still has to pass the program's verification and external-review boundaries.

## How to challenge this page

Start with the selection, then follow the evidence. Use [Browse All Results]({{ '/results/browse/' | relative_url }}) to see what was not selected, [Progress Against Agenda]({{ '/results/progress-against-agenda/' | relative_url }}) to see the obligation/status dashboard, and [Construction Spine Verification]({{ '/verify/construction-spine-verification/' | relative_url }}) to trace the build-order checks. For physics-facing claims, the decisive pressure is always the [Predictions / Falsification]({{ '/verify/predictions-and-falsification/' | relative_url }}) route.
