## What belongs here

Additional Derived Results are results produced by the framework that are not direct entries in the external Problem Ledger, not simply Recovery Target mappings, and not selected as curated landmarks.

They include domain-specific derived results, explanatory results, bridge results, supporting results, and consequences that still belong to the program's output.

<div class="notice note"><strong>Boundary note.</strong> This page is not an accountability mirror. Declared open-problem obligations belong to [Problem Answers]({{ '/results/problem-ledger-answers/' | relative_url }}), and declared recovery obligations belong to [Recovery Target Status]({{ '/results/recovery-target-status/' | relative_url }}).</div>

The dedicated [Additional Noteworthy Results]({{ '/results/additional-noteworthy-results/' | relative_url }}) route now carries Registry-backed results promoted from Corpus triage. It is a separate publication surface and does not change the generic Result catalogue count.
