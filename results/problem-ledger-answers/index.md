## Answer Mirror

> Current program stances against the open and foundational problems accepted in the Research Agenda.

This is the Results-side answer mirror of the Program-side Problem Ledger. It reports where the current public result surface has an answer, partial answer, structural constraint, or pending stance.

<div class="notice note"><strong>Status note.</strong> A program stance is not the same as external acceptance, scientific settlement, or final verification.</div>

## Browse by domain
