<div class="notice note"><strong>Status note.</strong> This page reports current recovery status. It does not imply external acceptance unless explicitly stated.</div>

## Status Separation

- Internal status: **Partial**
- Verification state: **Pending physics verification**
- External status: **Not externally reviewed**

## Requirement

Physical recovery begins with typed quantities: time, length, energy, charge, temperature, count, and luminosity cannot be treated as interchangeable labels.

## Current Recovery Status

- Recovery status: **Partial**
- Verification status: **Pending physics verification**
- Program ledger item: [PREC-P0](/agenda/core-semantics/physics/physical-quantity-types/)
- Verification mode: `quantity_type_recovery`

## Result Summary

A physics-facing kernel must explain why physical quantities have stable roles before it can claim to recover laws, constants, or measurements. This item therefore tests whether the framework carries a typed measurement grammar rather than an untyped numerical fit.

## What This Status Does Not Yet Establish

- It does not claim that every conventional unit is ontically primitive.
- It does not claim that public measurement practice is already fully derived.
- It does not replace empirical calibration with formal notation.
