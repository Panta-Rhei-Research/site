## Results is where the built Corpus becomes a world

The [Corpus]({{ '/corpus/' | relative_url }}) shows how the structure was built. Results shows what follows from that construction: landmark consequences, world readouts, current answers to the Problem Ledger, recovery-target status, and additional derived results.

Every result should be read with its status markers. An internally addressed result is not the same as external verification or scientific acceptance.

The intended reading order is simple:

<div class="v2-system-strip" aria-label="Results pipeline">
  <a href="{{ '/program/research-agenda/' | relative_url }}">Agenda</a>
  <span>-></span>
  <a href="{{ '/corpus/' | relative_url }}">Corpus</a>
  <span>-></span>
  <a href="{{ '/results/' | relative_url }}">Results</a>
  <span>-></span>
  <a href="{{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}">Verify</a>
</div>

The Agenda states the burden. The Corpus carries the build. Results shows the current answers and world-readouts. Verify exposes the inspection routes.

## Results are consequences, not isolated claims

{% capture results_plate_02_caption %}Results are not isolated claims. They are consequences that should be read against prior obligations, Corpus construction, and Verify surfaces.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-02-from-obligation-to-inspection" class="scientific-plate--spine" caption=results_plate_02_caption loading="lazy" %}

Results should be read against the obligations they answer, the Corpus construction that supports them, and the Verify routes that inspect them.

## Six ways to read Results

<ol class="v2-grid v2-card-list">
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/landmark-results/' | relative_url }}">
      <strong>Landmark Results</strong>
      <span>Curated high-impact consequences, status-marked and not exhaustive.</span>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/world-readout/' | relative_url }}">
      <strong>World Readout</strong>
      <span>Domain-level pictures of mathematics, physics, life, and metaphysics.</span>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/problem-ledger-answers/' | relative_url }}">
      <strong>Problem Ledger Answers</strong>
      <span>Current stances against accepted public open-problem stress tests.</span>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/recovery-target-status/' | relative_url }}">
      <strong>Recovery Target Status</strong>
      <span>Current recovery status against declared recovery requirements.</span>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/additional-derived-results/' | relative_url }}">
      <strong>Additional Derived Results</strong>
      <span>Framework results not captured by the curated landmarks or ledger mirrors.</span>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/progress-against-agenda/' | relative_url }}">
      <strong>Progress Against Agenda</strong>
      <span>A dashboard over problem and recovery obligations.</span>
    </a>
  </li>
</ol>

## Current state snapshot

The older result catalogue still uses the historical topic labels `biology` and `philosophy` in data. In the v2.2 public lane language, those correspond to the broader **Life** and **Metaphysics / Philosophy** agenda domains unless a page states a narrower scope.

<div class="v2-grid">
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/browse/' | relative_url }}">
    <strong>{{ result_count }} total result pages</strong>
    <span>The full crawlable catalogue with filters for domain, kind, importance, status, and book.</span>
  </a>
  {% for group in topic_groups %}
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/topic/' | append: group.name | append: '/' | relative_url }}">
    {% assign public_topic_label = group.name | capitalize %}
    {% assign public_topic_scope = group.name %}
    {% if group.name == "biology" %}
      {% assign public_topic_label = "Life-facing results" %}
      {% assign public_topic_scope = "Life" %}
    {% elsif group.name == "philosophy" %}
      {% assign public_topic_label = "Metaphysics / Philosophy-facing results" %}
      {% assign public_topic_scope = "Metaphysics / Philosophy" %}
    {% endif %}
    <strong>{{ group.size }} {{ public_topic_label }}</strong>
    <span>Problem-facing results currently grouped under {{ public_topic_scope }}.</span>
  </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Status legend

- **Internally addressed** — the current framework contains an internal answer, derivation, or structural stance.
- **Partial** — the framework has a partial result, recovery, or bridge, but further work remains.
- **Qualitative** — the result is conceptual or interpretive rather than quantitative or formal.
- **Contradicted** — the result is marked as conflicting with a target or requirement.
- **Not addressed** — no current public stance is available.

These labels report the program's internal status. They do not indicate external verification or scientific acceptance.

## Result families

<div class="v2-grid">
  {% for group in type_groups %}
  <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ '/results/classifications/' | relative_url }}#{{ group.name | slugify }}">
    <strong>{{ group.name | replace: "_", " " | capitalize }}</strong>
    <span>{{ group.size }} entries in the current catalogue.</span>
  </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Core routes

- [Progress Against Agenda]({{ '/results/progress-against-agenda/' | relative_url }}) mirrors Results back to the Program lane.
- [Problem Ledger Answers]({{ '/results/problem-ledger-answers/' | relative_url }}) organizes current stances against public problem obligations.
- [Recovery Target Status]({{ '/results/recovery-target-status/' | relative_url }}) reports current recovery status against declared recovery requirements.
- [Result Classifications]({{ '/results/classifications/' | relative_url }}) explains what kind of result each page claims to be.
- [World Readout]({{ '/results/world-readout/' | relative_url }}) gives the domain-level picture implied by the current results.
- [Browse All Results]({{ '/results/browse/' | relative_url }}) exposes the full catalogue.
- Related Verify surfaces carry the sharpest empirical pressure points: [Predictions]({{ '/results/predictions/browse/' | relative_url }}), [Falsification Paths]({{ '/results/falsifications/browse/' | relative_url }}), and [Prediction Timing]({{ '/results/predictions/timing/' | relative_url }}).
