## Why physics recovery begins with measurement

Physics recovery is not just equation recovery. A candidate kernel must recover physical quantity types, dimensional algebra, internal units, empirical calibration bridges, constants, dynamical laws, regime transitions, and measurement conditions.

SI is a bridge target, not a primitive input. Dimensionful constants require unit bridges; dimensionless constants and ratios are sharper numerical targets.

## Relation to the Physics Problem Ledger

The Physics Problem Ledger tracks open questions. Physics Recovery tracks the baseline measurement-and-law architecture those questions presuppose.
