## Source rule

Physics uses the full pinned Wikipedia list of unsolved problems in physics as the master ledger. Problem Ledger v1.0 promotes the extracted named entries into public agenda items while keeping solution, verification, and external acceptance separate.

## Import Coverage

<table>
  <thead><tr><th scope="col">Source scope</th><th scope="col">Public items</th><th scope="col">Merged</th><th scope="col">Excluded</th><th scope="col">Deferred</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr><td>102</td><td>102</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

## Public Problem Items

<div class="dep-list">
  {% for problem in items %}
  <a class="dep-link" href="{{ problem.url | relative_url }}">
    <span class="dep-id">{{ problem.canonical_problem_id }}</span>
    <span class="dep-title">{{ problem.title }}</span>
    <span class="chip" style="margin-left:auto">{{ problem.program.result_status | replace: "_", " " }}</span>
  </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Merged Source Entries

_No Physics source entries are merged in v1.0._

## Excluded Source Entries

_No Physics source entries are excluded in v1.0; historical solved sections and non-entry source sections were skipped during extraction rather than admitted as source entries._

## Deferred Source Entries

_No Physics source entries are deferred in v1.0._
