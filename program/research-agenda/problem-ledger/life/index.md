## Source rule

Life uses the pinned biology and neuroscience master ledgers. Medicine is excluded as a v2 master ledger because it is primarily clinical and translational rather than the core life-system stress test.

<div class="dep-list">
  {% for problem in items %}
  <a class="dep-link" href="{{ problem.url | relative_url }}">
    <span class="dep-id">{{ problem.canonical_problem_id }}</span>
    <span class="dep-title">{{ problem.title }}</span>
    <span class="chip" style="margin-left:auto">{{ problem.program.result_status | replace: "_", " " }}</span>
  </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Merged Source Entries

Ten biology/neuroscience overlaps are merged into canonical public items. The public pages retain the relevant source-entry IDs so the source accounting remains visible.

## Excluded Source Entries

_No Life source entries are excluded in v1.0. Medicine remains excluded as a master ledger source rather than as item-level exclusions._

## Deferred Source Entries

_No Life source entries are deferred in v1.0._
