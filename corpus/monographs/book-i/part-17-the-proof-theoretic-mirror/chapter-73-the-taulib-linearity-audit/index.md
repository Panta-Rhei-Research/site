The Diagonal–Linear Correspondence
(the relevant chapter, I.T37)
identified a structural isomorphism
between K5's diagonal discipline
and the !-free fragment of linear logic.
That correspondence operates at the level of design principles.
This chapter descends to the level of code.
TauLib — the Lean 4 formalization of Book I —
consists of 77 modules comprising approximately 15,900 lines.
The **Linearity Census Theorem**
(the relevant theorem, I.T38)
reports the empirical finding:
74 of 77 modules use zero classical axioms.
The remaining 3 sites —
2 uses of `Classical.em` in
`Coordinates/Primes.lean`
and 1 `funext` tactic call in
`Holomorphy/SpectralCoefficients.lean` —
are analyzed individually.
The `Classical.em` sites are eliminable
via decidable instances
(Proposition [prop:em-eliminable], I.P38).
The `funext` is a Lean kernel axiom
used tactically, not a classical commitment.
The chapter concludes with an honest
**Gap Declaration**
(Remark [rem:gap-declaration], I.R17):
what remains unearned,
and how Book III's self-enrichment program
will address it.
