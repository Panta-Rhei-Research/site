In classical complex analysis,
the identity theorem states:
if two holomorphic functions agree
on a set with an accumulation point,
they agree everywhere.
This rigidity —
the determination of a global function
by local data —
is the hallmark of holomorphy.
Does τ-holomorphy enjoy a similar rigidity?
This chapter proves that it does,
and in a stronger form.
The **τ-Identity Theorem**
(the relevant theorem, I.T21)
shows that agreement at a single primorial depth d₀
forces global equality on all omega-tails.
The proof uses tower coherence
(the relevant definition, I.D46)
and the CRT coherence structure
(the relevant theorem, I.T18)
rather than Taylor series or analytic continuation.
The key intermediate result is
**Tail Agreement Propagation**
(Lemma [lem:tail-agreement-propagation], I.L07):
agreement at depth d₀ propagates *upward*
through the primorial tower to all depths.
This is the opposite direction from classical analysis,
where agreement propagates via analytic continuation.
In τ, the Chinese Remainder Theorem
forces upward propagation.
We also define the space Hol(𝕃)
(the relevant definition, I.D49)
of τ-holomorphic functions
on the algebraic lemniscate,
whose elements are uniquely determined
by finite-depth data —
a consequence that will be exploited
in the Global Hartogs Theorem
.
