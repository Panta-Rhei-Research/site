the relevant chapter showed that classical D-holomorphy
— split-complex holomorphy with j² = +1 —
is crippled by zero divisors:
the idempotents e_+ = (1+j)/2 and e_- = (1-j)/2
satisfy e_+ · e_- = 0,
allowing pathological functions that vanish on one sector
and behave arbitrarily on the other.
the relevant chapter defined the
τ-holomorphic functions (HolFun, I.D47)
as D-holomorphic functions that additionally satisfy
tower coherence.
This chapter proves that HolFun is *protected*
from the zero-divisor pathology
by two independent structural guards:
the diagonal discipline (axiom K5, I.D03)
and the Prime Polarity Theorem (I.T05).
The **No Simultaneous Projection** proposition (I.P23)
shows that no compatible omega-tail
can project nontrivially onto both sectors
through a τ-holomorphic function.
The **Diagonal-Free Protection Theorem** (I.T19)
elevates this to a full structural guarantee:
the zero-divisor product e_+ · e_- = 0
cannot arise as T(t₁) · T(t₂)
for any T ∈ HolFun
and any compatible omega-tails t₁, t₂.
The chapter concludes by proving that HolFun
is closed under composition (I.T20)
and that composition is associative (I.P24),
giving HolFun a **monoid structure**
that will serve as the substrate
for the earned category Cat_τ in Part XIII.
