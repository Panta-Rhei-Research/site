The 1st Edition of this series imported category theory
as an external language —
objects, morphisms, composition, and identity were
*postulated* as ambient infrastructure,
then applied to the τ-framework.
The 2nd Edition takes a fundamentally different path:
it *earns* the categorical structure
from the monoid of τ-holomorphic functions
that Part XII assembled.
This chapter constructs the **earned category**
Cat_τ
(the relevant definition, I.D51)
whose arrows are **τ-arrows** —
normal-form equivalence classes of τ-holomorphic programs
(the relevant definition, I.D50).
The category axioms —
identity, composition, associativity —
are not assumed;
they are *proved*
(the relevant theorem, I.T22)
from the HolFun monoid structure:
composition closure
(the relevant theorem, I.T20),
associativity
(Proposition [prop:holfun-associativity], I.P24),
and the identity transformer from the program monoid
(the relevant theorem, I.T03).
The proof is short
because all the hard work was done in Part XII.
A striking consequence is that Cat_τ
is a **thin category**
(Proposition [prop:thin-category], I.P25):
between any two objects,
there is at most one arrow.
Thinness is not an axiom —
it is a *consequence*
of the τ-Identity Theorem
(the relevant theorem, I.T21,
the relevant chapter):
holomorphic rigidity forces uniqueness of arrows,
just as it forces uniqueness of HolFuns.
The remaining chapters of Part XIV build on Cat_τ:
functors ,
limits and sites ,
and the earned topos .
