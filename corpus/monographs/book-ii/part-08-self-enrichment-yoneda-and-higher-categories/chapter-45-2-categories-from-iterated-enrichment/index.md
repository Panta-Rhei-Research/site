the relevant chapter
established that τ enriches over itself:
the morphism space Hom(A,B)
is itself an object of τ (II.D53),
equipped with bipolar decomposition
Hom(A,B) = e_+ · Hom_+(A,B)
+ e_- · Hom_-(A,B) (II.P11).
the relevant chapter
proved the Yoneda embedding τ ↪ [τ^op, τ]
as a *theorem* (II.T36).
This chapter asks:
what happens when we iterate?
Since Hom(A,B) is a τ-object,
and τ enriches over itself,
we can form
Hom(Hom(A,B), Hom(C,D))—morphisms
between morphisms.
These are **2-morphisms**,
and they organize into a **2-categorical structure**
on τ.
The key facts are:
(1) the 2-category τ₂ is well-defined
(the relevant definition, II.D55);
(2) 2-morphisms inherit bipolar decomposition
from the split-complex codomain
(the relevant definition, II.D56);
(3) the construction iterates to produce
n-morphisms for each finite n
(Proposition [prop:enrichment-iteration], II.P12);
(4) this is the concrete realization
of the E₀ → E₁ transition
in the enrichment frontier (I.D82, Book I).
The honest limitation:
we have earned the 2-categorical structure
and, in principle, the finite iteration to n-categories.
We have *not* earned
an ∞-categorical structure.
The passage from finite iteration
to a genuine ∞-category
requires coherence data at all levels simultaneously,
which belongs to the enrichment ladder's
E₁ → E₂ transition—the domain of Book III.
