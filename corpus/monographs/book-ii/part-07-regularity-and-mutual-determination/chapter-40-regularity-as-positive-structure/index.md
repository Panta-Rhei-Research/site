What does it mean for a function to be regular at a point?
In classical complex analysis,
the answer is *negative*:
a function is regular where it is *not* singular.
Regularity is defined by the *absence* of pathology —
the absence of poles, branch points,
or essential singularities.
One first defines what can go wrong,
then declares regularity to be
the complement of wrongness.

In Category τ,
regularity is a *positive* condition:
the *existence* of a stabilized ω-germ.
A point p ∈ τ³ is τ-regular for a function f
if the sequence of ω-germ restrictions
stabilizes at a finite primorial stage —
if finitely much boundary data suffices
to determine f at p.
This chapter introduces
**τ-Regularity**
(the relevant definition, II.D49),
proves the
**Regularity Criterion**
(the relevant theorem, II.T34),
which establishes a sharp dichotomy —
every point is either τ-regular
(stabilization at finite stage)
or genuinely singular
(the germ sequence diverges) —
and explains in
**Remark [rem:positive-negative-regularity**] (II.R11)
why the classical notion of "removable singularity"
has no τ-analogue.
The ultrametric topology
admits no epsilon-delta wiggle room:
cylinders are clopen,
so singularities cannot be "approached" and then "removed."
They are either present at a given stage or absent.

The key dependencies are:
the Global Hartogs Theorem
(I.T31, the Global Hartogs Extension (Book I, Chapter 62))
establishes that boundary data determines interior data;
the Idempotent Decomposition Lemma
(II.L07, the relevant chapter)
provides the canonical e_±-splitting;
the Holomorphic ⇔ Idempotent-Supported
equivalence
(II.T33, the relevant chapter)
characterizes holomorphic maps;
and the evolution operator
(II.D37, the relevant chapter)
provides the propagation mechanism
through which stabilization occurs.
