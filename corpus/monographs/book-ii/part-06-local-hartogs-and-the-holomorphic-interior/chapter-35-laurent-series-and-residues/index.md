Classical Laurent theory
expands a holomorphic function
in an annulus {r₁ < |z| < r₂}
as a doubly-infinite power series
∑_{n=-∞}^∞ a_n z^n,
with the residue a_-1
computed by contour integration
around the singularity Ahlfors1979,Conway1978.
None of this machinery is available
in the split-complex setting:
there is no rotation group SO(2),
no contour integration,
and no annular domains
in the sense of ℂ.
This chapter develops the
τ-analogue of Laurent expansion.
The key insight is that the bipolar spectral decomposition
(I.T10, I.D21, Book I)
replaces the circular Fourier decomposition.
A τ-holomorphic function
decomposes into two independent channel series:
<div class="math-display">f
 =
 ∑_n a_n e_+ φ_n^(+)
 +
 ∑_n b_n e_- φ_n^(-),</div>
where φ_n^(±) are the sector basis functions.
**Residues** emerge as
spectral coefficients at distinguished frequencies
(the relevant definition, II.D43)—not
from contour integrals but from
the spectral projection operators
of Part V's calibration.
The **Residue Theorem**
(the relevant theorem, II.T30)
shows that the sum of residues
equals the **spectral trace**,
a quantity computable from the
boundary character alone.
