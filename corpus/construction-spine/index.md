## What this spine is

The Construction Spine is the Corpus-side realization of the Agenda's Construction Roadmap. It shows how the Corpus is built step by step: from kernel definition through mathematics, physics, life, reflective structure, self-hosting, and ontic closure.

## From kernel to ontic closure

{% capture construction_spine_plate_caption %}The Construction Spine gives the human-readable build order of the Corpus: from the formal kernel through mathematical recovery, physical grammar, empirical bridges, life, reflection, self-hosting, and ontic closure.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-04-construction-spine" class="scientific-plate--construction-spine" caption=construction_spine_plate_caption loading="lazy" %}

The ten construction steps show how the Corpus is built: not as a timeline or sprint plan, but as a logical build order from the formal kernel to ontic-closure testing.

## One spine, several projections

- [Registry]({{ '/corpus/registry/' | relative_url }}) is the atomic item projection.
- [TauLib]({{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}) is the Lean formalization projection.
- The [Monograph Corpus]({{ '/corpus/monograph-corpus/' | relative_url }}) is the narrative proof-order projection.
- [Publications]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}) are the citable artifact and release shelf.
- [Corpus Graph]({{ '/corpus/graph/' | relative_url }}) is the dependency projection.
- [Bi-Square Motif]({{ '/corpus/bi-square/' | relative_url }}) is the diagrammatic-shape route: tower coherence, spectral naturality, and pasting across the main algebraic, geometric, enriched, and computational lifts.
- [Thirty Open Problems as τ-Readout Surfaces]({{ '/publications/research-notes/thirty-open-problems-tau-readout-surfaces/' | relative_url }}) is a derived publication projection: an external expressiveness probe that checks whether the construction grammar yields differentiated answer-shapes without claiming solved results.

## Kernel starting point

{% capture tau_kernel_plate_caption %}The τ-Kernel is the constrained formal core from which the construction begins: five generators, one primitive iterator, K0–K6 axiomatic constraints, and constructive closure under a no-hidden-runtime / no-hidden-substrate discipline.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-10-tau-kernel" variant="thumb" class="scientific-plate--compact scientific-plate--tau-kernel" caption=tau_kernel_plate_caption loading="lazy" %}

The first construction step defines the kernel before later mathematics, physics, life, reflection, self-hosting, and ontic-closure burdens can be read as generated structure.

### Construction review packet

The first three construction steps are supported by a construction review packet: eight standalone research papers plus a bundle memo. These papers isolate the make-or-break mathematical constructions behind the τ-Kernel, recovered mathematics, and self-enrichment. Use the review packet when you want the stress-test packet rather than the full monograph or atomic registry.

## The ten construction steps

<ol class="v2-grid v2-step-list">
{% for step in steps %}
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ step.corpus_path | relative_url }}">
      <article>
        <h3>{{ step.sequence }}. {{ step.title }}</h3>
        <p>{{ step.summary }}</p>
        <span class="chip">{{ step.build_status | replace: "_", " " }}</span>
      </article>
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>

## End-to-end construction view

The ten construction steps are not isolated pages. They form one construction chain.

Each step inherits exactly what earlier steps have earned and hands forward what later steps need:

1. the kernel establishes the constrained formal core;
2. core mathematics earns syntax, number, geometry, topology, and bridge discipline;
3. self-enrichment begins the internalization of logic and meta-language;
4. the physical carrier identifies where physics can live;
5. internal physical grammar builds τ-time, τ-space, τ-mass, τ-energy, observables, and laws;
6. measurement bridges connect internal physics to empirical accountability;
7. life is recovered as a structural class;
8. reflective structure recovers mind, language, meaning, truth, value, and normativity;
9. formal systems and the kernel itself become internal objects;
10. ontic closure tests no-externalities, substrate non-deferral, proof/commitment boundary, and residual frontiers.

The [Monograph Corpus]({{ '/corpus/monograph-corpus/' | relative_url }}) shows how the seven books realize this chain across their parts and chapters.

## How to read this section

Each step page explains what the step builds, why it is required, the key constructions, related Registry items, TauLib modules, book locations, related Results, Verify surfaces, and what the step does not yet establish.

Use [Verify the Construction Spine]({{ '/verify/construction-spine-verification/' | relative_url }}) when you want the inspection matrix rather than the build narrative.

Use [Related Approaches]({{ '/program/about/related-approaches/' | relative_url }}) when you want to compare this construction burden with neighboring structural, computational, geometric, life, mind, and metaphysical programs.

<div class="notice note"><strong>Status note.</strong> Build status reflects the current internal state of the Corpus. It does not imply external acceptance unless explicitly stated.</div>

## Build status legend

- **Framed** — the step is defined as a required construction obligation.
- **Partially built** — relevant Corpus structures exist, but mappings or verification remain incomplete.
- **Internally addressed** — the Corpus contains a substantive internal construction for this step.
- **Bridge pending** — internal structures exist, but measurement, standard-domain, or external bridge verification remains open.

These labels describe the program's internal construction state. They do not indicate external verification or scientific acceptance.
