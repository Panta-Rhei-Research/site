## N1: Prediction

$| gen| = 3$ exactly,
from $H_1(τ^3;ℤ) ≅ ℤ^3$
(IV.T171).
Any observation of a fourth-generation fermion
at any mass scale
falsifies $τ$'s topological generation theorem.
*Experiment:* LHC Run 3+, FCC.
*Timeline:* ongoing–2040.


## Derivation Context

The number of fermion generations
equals the rank
of the first integer homology
of the $τ^3$ fibration:

The result $|gen| = 3$
is established by three independent arguments,
each drawing on different mathematical structures:

- **$H_1$ rank = $(τ^3)$**
(Theorem (thm:ch60-three-gen-rank)).
The first homology group
of $τ^3$ has rank 3
by the K\"unneth computation
(eq:ch60-kunneth).
This is the most direct proof:
the topological structure of $τ^3$
forces exactly three independent one-cycles.

The fiber $T^2 = (R · S^1) × (ι_τ R · S^1)$
with aspect ratio $r/R = ι_τ$
carries a Laplacian
whose primitive eigenvalue spectrum
(modes $(n,m)$ with $(n,m) = 1$)
supports exactly three stable generation modes
below the first composite-mode threshold:
$λ_(1,0) = 1$,
$λ_(0,1) = ι_τ^-2 ≈ 8.585$,
$λ_(1,1) = 1 + ι_τ^-2 ≈ 9.585$.
The next primitive mode $(2,1)$
has $λ_(2,1) ≈ 12.58$,
exceeding the composite threshold $λ_(2,0) = 4$.
No fourth light generation exists.
