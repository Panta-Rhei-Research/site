## Engagement without endorsement

Engagement does not require agreement.

The program needs different kinds of attention: careful readers, public questions, specific critique, reproducibility checks, domain review, corrections, infrastructure contributions, responsible communication, institutional dialogue, and non-endorsement support.

## Choose the kind of attention you can offer

Engagement does not begin with agreement. It begins with a useful form of attention: reading, inspection, critique, review, contribution, responsible communication, institutional dialogue, or support without endorsement.

## Where to start

If your question can help other readers, begin with [Public Discussions]({{ '/engage/discussions/' | relative_url }}).

If your concern is concrete and actionable, use the relevant issue tracker:

- [Site issues](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/site/issues)
- [TauLib issues](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/taulib/issues)
- [Publications issues](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/publications/issues)
- [Research issues](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/research/issues)
- [Community issues](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/community/issues)

If your message is private, institutional, media-related, sensitive, or support-related, use [Contact]({{ '/engage/contact/' | relative_url }}).

## Minimum good-faith posture

You do not need to agree with the theory or its conclusions. You do need to engage the right object: a book, a result, a registry object, a formalization surface, an empirical prediction, a source record, a public briefing, or a stated assumption. The engagement routes above are designed to make that object easy to find.

If you want a first-pass outside-in orientation before posting publicly, use [AI-Assisted Discovery]({{ '/discover/ai-assisted-discovery/' | relative_url }}). Treat LLM output as orientation, not verification.
