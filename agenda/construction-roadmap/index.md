## This is not a timeline

The Construction Roadmap is not a calendar, sprint plan, or publication schedule. It is the logical build-order implied by the program's own burden of proof.

If the program seeks a no-externalities kernel of reality, it cannot begin by assuming mathematics, physics, life, mind, meaning, or lawfulness as finished inputs. These layers must be recovered in order.

This is the construction-side counterpart to Package 2’s doctrine: [The Shape of a Theory of Reality]({{ '/publications/white-papers/the-shape-of-a-theory-of-reality/' | relative_url }}) frames “coherent theory of reality” as a build burden, not a completion claim or theory-of-everything slogan.

## Agenda roadmap and Corpus spine

{% capture construction_roadmap_plate_caption %}The Construction Roadmap states what must be built; the Construction Spine shows the Corpus-side build narrative, with side projections for Registry, TauLib, Monograph Corpus, and Corpus Graph.{% endcapture %}
{% include scientific-plate.html id="plate-04-construction-spine" variant="thumb" class="scientific-plate--compact" caption=construction_roadmap_plate_caption loading="lazy" %}

The Construction Roadmap states the build-order obligation. The Construction Spine shows the Corpus-side realization of that order.

## Why construction order matters

The other Agenda surfaces state what the program must face: Core Semantics, open problems, and the ontic-status burden. The Construction Roadmap explains how those burdens become a construction sequence.

<div class="v2-system-strip" aria-label="Construction sequence across lanes">
  <a href="{{ '/agenda/construction-roadmap/' | relative_url }}">Agenda obligation</a>
  <span>-></span>
  <a href="{{ '/corpus/construction-spine/' | relative_url }}">Corpus construction</a>
  <span>-></span>
  <a href="{{ '/results/progress-against-agenda/' | relative_url }}">Results status</a>
</div>

## The 10 construction steps

<ol class="v2-grid v2-step-list">
{% for step in steps %}
  <li>
    <a class="v2-tile" href="{{ step.corpus_path | relative_url }}">
      <article>
        <h3>{{ step.sequence }}. {{ step.title }}</h3>
        <p>{{ step.required_to_do }}</p>
        <span class="chip">{{ step.build_status | replace: "_", " " }}</span>
      </article>
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>

## How this roadmap appears in Corpus

In the Agenda, the sequence names obligations: what must be built and why. In the [Corpus Construction Spine]({{ '/corpus/construction-spine/' | relative_url }}), the same sequence becomes the public construction narrative: what has been built, where it appears in the Registry, how TauLib touches it, and which publications narrate it.

## How this roadmap appears in Verify

In [Verify the Construction Spine]({{ '/verify/construction-spine-verification/' | relative_url }}), the same sequence becomes an inspection matrix: what would count as formal checking, bridge review, empirical pressure, or failure for each construction step.

## How this roadmap appears in Results

In Results, the sequence is not the primary organizing principle. Results is where the built Corpus becomes a world: landmark consequences, world readouts, Problem Ledger answers, Recovery Target status, and the [Progress Against Agenda]({{ '/results/progress-against-agenda/' | relative_url }}) dashboard.

## Current status and next reading

Each step carries an internal build status. These statuses do not imply external acceptance or final verification. They are reading aids for tracing obligation, construction, result, and verification together.
