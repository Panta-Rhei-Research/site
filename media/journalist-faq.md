## How to use this page

This page is a **journalist/editor view of the canonical FAQ collection**. FAQ entries live once in the Corpus metadata layer (`corpus/faqs/`) and are rendered here as a media-facing persona-filtered view. For the full FAQ across all five layers, see the canonical [Frequently Asked Questions]({{ '/faq/' | relative_url }}).

This FAQ is written for **journalists, podcast hosts, editors, and public communicators** writing about the Panta Rhei Research Program. The questions and answers are short by design — each one is a paragraph or two with links into the canonical lanes for deeper context. If you cannot find an answer here, write to [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site) and we will route the question.

For specialist-level questions (formal-methods reviewers, domain experts), see the separate [Red-team FAQ]({{ '/program/about/red-team-faq/' | relative_url }}), [How to Verify]({{ '/verify/how-to-verify/' | relative_url }}), and [Assessment Protocols]({{ '/verify/assessment-protocols/' | relative_url }}).

For the shortest citable orientation, start with [*Panta Rhei at a Glance*]({{ '/publications/anchor-documents/wp000-panta-rhei-at-a-glance/' | relative_url }}) (WP000), then use the [Anchor Documents]({{ '/publications/anchor-documents/' | relative_url }}) for the longer canon.

## Inspection architecture and proof status

The questions below are sourced from the canonical FAQ entity collection (`corpus/faqs/`). Each entry has a stable ID and links to its source pages for deeper context.

{%- comment -%}
  HF-04-v2 (polish wave) · the first entry in the first section opens
  expanded so a journalist arriving here sees a real answer immediately
  without a click. Subsequent sections stay collapsed (questions-as-
  index). Default `expand_first` is false everywhere else (homepage,
  /faq/ canonical).

  AUD-30 · Deep-link into the canonical FAQ filtered for journalists.
  The /faq/?audience=journalist query param triggers the audience-
  filter chips on the canonical FAQ page, surfacing only entries whose
  audience array includes "journalist" — collapses the four
  overlapping surfaces (First-Contact / Journalist / Review Kit /
  Media Kit) onto a single canonical directory with filtered views.

## Who funds the program?

The Panta Rhei Research Program is **independently authored and self-funded** by Dr. Thorsten Fuchs and Anna-Sophie Fuchs. There is no institutional funding, no grant sponsor, and no corporate backer. There is no funder to disclose because there is no funder.

This is part of why the program is published as an open architecture rather than as a journal-by-journal submission: independence of funding makes it natural to publish independently.

## How should I refer to the work?

The program-level name is **Panta Rhei Research Program**. The framework's name is **Category τ** (sometimes written **τ** or **Cat τ** in technical writing). The principal authors are **Dr. Thorsten Fuchs** (architect of Category τ, principal author of the monograph series) and **Anna-Sophie Fuchs** (co-author of the series and co-developer of the public surfaces).

The shortest accurate framing is:

> Panta Rhei is an independent open research program dedicated to building a coherent theory of reality, published as an inspectable research observatory.

Three boilerplate length variants — 1-line, 30-word, and 100-word — are available on the [Media Kit]({{ '/media/' | relative_url }}#program-boilerplate-copy-paste-ready) page. Use them as-is for press releases, abstracts, or article bylines.

## How do I cite a specific result?

Each result has a stable URL and a typed status label. For citation:

- **Books** — see [Cite]({{ '/cite/' | relative_url }}) for the canonical book DOIs and ORCID IDs.
- **Research papers** — each paper carries its own DOI on Zenodo (e.g. [10.5281/zenodo.19820352](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19820352) for the Master Constant ι_τ paper).
- **Registry objects** — every theorem, definition, and proof object on the public registry has a stable ID (e.g. `I.K0`, `II.T48`) and a permalink under [`/corpus/registry/`]({{ '/corpus/registry/' | relative_url }}).
- **BibTeX** — the program publishes a [BibTeX bibliography]({{ '/assets/bibliography/references.bib' | relative_url }}) ({% include release-metric.html id="bibliography.references" unit=true %}) for direct inclusion in your tooling.

For citation discipline questions, see [Cite]({{ '/cite/' | relative_url }}) for the canonical guidance.

## Can I quote the authors directly?

**Yes.** Direct quotes for editorial use are available on request. Email [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site) with the angle and outlet; the authors will reply with quotes you may attribute by name.

For longer-form interviews, podcast appearances, or background briefings, see the next question.

## Are interviews / podcasts / video available?

Interview windows and podcast appearances are available on request. Send a brief outline (outlet, audience, format, anticipated length, deadline) to [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site).

The principal authors are based in Germany (Central European time). Remote interviews via the major videoconferencing platforms are the default; in-person interviews are arrangeable on a case-by-case basis.

## Is there an embargo policy?

The program publishes openly: every monograph, every research paper, every registry entry is **already public**. There is therefore no embargo on currently published material — what is on the website may be quoted and linked freely.

For **upcoming** material (e.g., a draft research paper shared with a reporter ahead of formal release), please confirm release dates with [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site) before publication. Standard practice is a short courtesy embargo until the formal release, with the understanding that the published version is what should be cited.

## Are headshots and brand assets available?

**Author headshots** — high-resolution headshots of the principal authors are available on request via [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site). See `/assets/media/headshots/README.md` in the [site repository](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/site) for the headshot inventory and directly-downloadable files (when published).

**Brand assets** — the πρ wordmark, lockups, color palette, and social headers live at [`/brand/`]({{ '/brand/' | relative_url }}) (SVG/PNG, with usage guidelines).

**Scientific plates** — the program's [visual atlas]({{ '/media/posters/' | relative_url }}) carries 1536 × 864 print-quality JPGs of every scientific plate, all under CC BY 4.0.

## Has the work been covered elsewhere?

**As of April 2026 — not yet.** This is an independent research program publishing openly; press coverage is welcome but not yet present. We will update this section as third-party coverage appears. If you publish a piece, please send the link to [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site) so we can add it to a future "Recent Coverage" surface.

## What's a good "story angle" for an article?

Five framings work well for general readers — see [Story Angles]({{ '/media/story-angles/' | relative_url }}) for the full list with suggested ledes and key facts. Short headline-fits:

- "Independent researcher derives Standard-Model constants from a single algebraic seed (ι_τ = 2/(π+e))."
- "A Lean 4 framework spans physics, biology, philosophy — and ships its own falsification tests."
- "CMB-S4 will measure r ≈ 0.0136 by 2030 — Category τ predicted that value, with zero free parameters."
- "Seven books, one operator: how a coherence kernel derives the periodic table without fitting."
- "A research program that publishes its falsifications alongside its claims."

## What should I avoid writing?

The program is independent research **under scrutiny**, not settled scientific consensus. Please do **not**:

- Describe internal program results as **externally accepted scientific conclusions** — they have not been peer-reviewed in traditional journals yet.
- Frame the program as a **theory of everything** — that is not the program's framing. The framing is "independent open research program dedicated to building a coherent theory of reality," with all claims open for scrutiny.
- **Conflate Lean compilation with empirical truth** — Lean checks internal consistency. CMB-S4, BICEP, particle-physics experiments still need to do their work.
- Drop the **scope labels** — every claim on the site carries a typed status label (`internally addressed`, `partial`, `conjectural`, …). Removing those labels strips out the program's accountability.

The correct posture is **inspectability**, not hype or dismissal. See [Independence, Scope & Scrutiny]({{ '/program/about/independence-scope-and-scrutiny/' | relative_url }}) for the canonical guidance.

## What if I find an error?

Please tell us. Email [errata@panta-rhei.site](mailto:errata@panta-rhei.site) or open an issue at [Panta-Rhei-Research/site](https://github.com/Panta-Rhei-Research/site/issues). The program treats correction routes as a structural feature, not an embarrassment — every claim's verification surface is part of what makes it a research program.
