## How to use this page

These are **five distinct framings** for covering the Panta Rhei Research Program. Each is paired with a suggested headline, a 30-second elevator pitch, and the **key-fact anchor** that makes the framing land without losing scope discipline. Use them as starting scaffolding — adapt freely for your audience and outlet.

If your angle isn't covered here, write to [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site) — the program is happy to provide quotes, background, or interview windows for framings we haven't anticipated.

For the journalism-specific Q&A (peer review, funding, citation, embargo), see the [Journalist FAQ]({{ '/media/journalist-faq/' | relative_url }}).

## Angle 1 — Independence

**Suggested headline.** *Independent researcher publishes a 7-book research program — and the formal verification, registry, and falsification tests that go with it.*

**30-second pitch.** Most modern research programs are downstream of grant funding, journal cycles, and institutional priorities. The Panta Rhei Research Program is a counter-example: an independent, self-funded, open architecture published on the open web, with the verification surfaces (Lean 4 formalization, registry of every theorem object, named falsification tests) shipped from day one. The principal authors — Dr. Thorsten Fuchs and Anna-Sophie Fuchs — chose the open posture deliberately because the program's claims are ambitious enough to warrant scrutiny, and the right way to invite scrutiny is to publish the entire structural surface in the open.

**Key-fact anchor.** *Self-funded · independent · published openly · Lean 4-formalized · review surfaces public from day one.*

## Angle 2 — Zero free parameters

**Suggested headline.** *A single algebraic constant — ι_τ = 2/(π+e) — derives every dimensionless ratio in physics with zero free parameters.*

**30-second pitch.** Modern theoretical physics has accumulated 19–26 free parameters (the Standard Model carries 19; cosmology adds more). Each is fitted to experiment. The Panta Rhei Research Program proposes a different bookkeeping: a single algebraic constant `ι_τ = 2/(π+e) ≈ 0.3413` derived from the categorical kernel, plus one empirical anchor (the neutron mass) — and from that pair, **every dimensionless ratio in physics cascades**, including the fine-structure constant α, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, and the gravitational coupling. The Lean 4 formalization checks the cascade is internally consistent. CMB-S4 will measure the framework's most-decisive prediction (the tensor-to-scalar ratio) to test it.

**Key-fact anchor.** *ι_τ = 2/(π+e) ≈ 0.341304… · 0 free parameters · 1 empirical anchor (m_n) · Standard-Model constants cascade from this.*

## Angle 3 — Falsification on day one

**Suggested headline.** *CMB-S4 will measure r ≈ 0.0136 by 2030 — Category τ predicted that value, and committed in advance.*

**30-second pitch.** A research program that publishes its **decisive falsification test** alongside its central claim is rare. Category τ predicts the CMB-S4 tensor-to-scalar ratio at `r ≈ ι_τ⁴ ≈ 0.0136`. CMB-S4 — the next-generation cosmic microwave background experiment, operational around 2030 — will measure r at a precision that **distinguishes this prediction from competing inflationary models**. If the measured value is close to 0.0136, the framework's central derivation succeeds. If r is materially different, the framework is in serious trouble — and the program has committed to that test in advance, in writing, with the prediction permanently published. This is what scientific accountability looks like when a program treats falsifiability as a structural feature, not a defensive afterthought.

**Key-fact anchor.** *Decisive test: CMB-S4 r ≈ 0.0136 · Date: ~2030 · Status: prediction published in advance · Failure mode: framework retracted.*

## Angle 4 — Cross-domain scope

**Suggested headline.** *One Lean 4 framework spans physics, biology, and philosophy — without surrendering rigor in any of them.*

**30-second pitch.** The Panta Rhei Research Program develops a single categorical framework — Category τ — and applies it across four canonical domains: mathematics (Books I–III), physics (Books IV–V), life (Book VI), and metaphysics (Book VII). Each domain carries its own verification grammar: mathematics gets Lean 4 proofs, physics gets numerical predictions and SI translations, life gets empirical correlates and biomarkers, metaphysics gets categorical narrowing principles. **The same kernel underlies all four.** What this enables is unusual: a unified framework that doesn't sacrifice formal rigor in mathematics, doesn't fudge numerical accountability in physics, doesn't hand-wave in biology, and doesn't dodge the philosophical questions. Each domain's verification surface is published openly under [`/verify/`]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}).

**Key-fact anchor.** *4 domains · 7 books · 1 categorical kernel · 282 glossary entries · 192 cross-domain bridge edges · Lean 4-formalized in mathematics + physics layers.*

## Angle 5 — Open verification

**Suggested headline.** *A research program that publishes its review surfaces alongside its claims.*

**30-second pitch.** The Panta Rhei Research Program publishes far more than its claims. It publishes the **Lean 4 formalization** ([TauLib]({{ '/verify/taulib/' | relative_url }}), 522 modules, the published formalized modules built without `sorry`), the **registry** of every theorem object with full dependency graphs, the **Trust Budget Disclosure** (which Lean axioms it uses beyond the kernel and why), the **Custom Axiom Inventory** (the three Book III axioms it asks reviewers to grant, finite-checked but not yet proven), the **Assessment Protocols** (structured critique routes for formal-methods, domain, and prior-art review), and the **Prediction Timing Ledger** (every numerical prediction with a real-world date). Reviewers don't have to ask "what does this program assume?" — every assumption is enumerated in the open with a stable URL.

**Key-fact anchor.** *Lean 4 formalization (522 modules) · 282 glossary entries · 4,863 machine-checked theorems · 67 numerical predictions · 30 falsification tests · 0 free parameters · all public.*

**Suggested deep links:**

## What to avoid

The program is **independent research under scrutiny**, not settled scientific consensus. The most common framings to avoid:

- **"Theory of everything."** Not the program's framing. The framing is "categorical framework with derivable results across multiple domains, all open for scrutiny."
- **"Peer-reviewed."** Not yet — the program is independent research, openly published. Peer review remains future work.
- **"Lean proves the physics is true."** Lean checks internal consistency of the formal framework. Empirical claims (CMB-S4, Standard-Model masses, etc.) still need empirical testing.
- **Stripped scope labels.** Every claim on the site carries a typed status label (`internally addressed`, `partial`, `conjectural`, …). Removing those labels strips the program's accountability.

For the canonical guidance on responsible framing, see [Independence, Scope & Scrutiny]({{ '/program/about/independence-scope-and-scrutiny/' | relative_url }}) and the [Journalist FAQ]({{ '/media/journalist-faq/' | relative_url }}#what-should-i-avoid-writing).
