## Short description

The Panta Rhei Research Program is an independent open research program developing **Category τ** — a categorical framework built from five generators, seven axioms, and one operator that derives results across mathematics, physics, biology, and philosophy from a single coherence kernel.

## What this is

This page gathers public materials for journalists, podcast hosts, public communicators, reviewers, and institutional readers. It is an entry surface into the current public site, not a replacement for the canonical lanes.

{% assign book_count = site.data.publications.books | size %}{% assign result_count = site.data.results.results | size %}{% assign registry_count = site.data.registry.objects | size %}{% assign chapter_count = site.data.publications.chapters | size %}The program's canonical release (April 2026) includes:
- A **{{ book_count }}-book monograph series** (~3,430 pages, available on Amazon KDP)
- A **Lean 4 formalization library** (TauLib, 522 modules; the published formalized modules are built without `sorry`, while Book VI remains registry-planned and not yet fully Lean-formalized — see [filter rules]({{ '/verify/filter-rules/' | relative_url }}))
- This **research website** ({{ result_count }} key results, {{ registry_count }} registry objects)
- **Guided tours** and **structural falsification whitepapers**

## What this is not

This media kit is not a peer-review certificate, not a claim that every result is settled, and not a shortcut around the verification surfaces. Use it for orientation, then follow the relevant Program, Corpus, Results, Verify, and Publications routes.

## Decisive test — CMB-S4 r ≈ 0.0136

The single most journalism-leverageable framing: the program ships a **decisive falsification test on day one**. Category τ predicts the CMB-S4 tensor-to-scalar ratio at

> r ≈ ι<sub>τ</sub>⁴ ≈ **0.0136**

CMB-S4 — the next-generation CMB experiment, operational around 2030 — will measure r at a precision that distinguishes this prediction from competing inflationary models. **The framework is committed in advance.** If r ≈ 0.0136 the prediction succeeds; if r is materially different, the framework is in serious trouble.

For the full timeline + all 30 named falsification tests, see [Predictions & Falsification]({{ '/verify/predictions-and-falsification/' | relative_url }}). For the angle's deeper framing, see [Story Angles → Falsification on day one]({{ '/media/story-angles/' | relative_url }}#angle-3--falsification-on-day-one).

### Program Boilerplate (copy-paste ready)

Three lengths are provided — pick whichever fits your headline / lede / body needs.

#### One-line (under 30 words)

#### Standard (≈100 words)

> The Panta Rhei Research Program develops **Category τ**, a categorical framework that derives results across mathematics, physics, biology, and philosophy from five generators, seven axioms, and one operator. The program's seven-book monograph series (2nd Edition, April 2026) is accompanied by a Lean 4 formalization library, {{ result_count }} key results with typed epistemic status, a public research website with {{ registry_count }} registry objects, and a published falsification ledger including a decisive CMB-S4 prediction (r ≈ 0.0136 by 2030). All claims carry explicit scope labels and verification routes. The program is independent research — not yet peer-reviewed in traditional journals.

> Distinctively, the framework operates with **zero dimensionless free parameters**: a single algebraic constant ι_τ = 2/(π+e) ≈ 0.3413, derived from the categorical kernel, plus one empirical anchor (the neutron mass) jointly determine every dimensionless ratio in the published constants ledger. The program publishes its falsification tests alongside its claims — most decisively, the CMB-S4 tensor-to-scalar prediction r ≈ ι_τ⁴ ≈ 0.0136, scheduled for measurement around 2030. The Lean 4 formalization (TauLib, 522 modules) checks the framework's internal consistency; the published formalized modules are built without `sorry`. All review surfaces are public from day one.

### Author Bios

**Dr. Thorsten Fuchs** is the principal author of the Panta Rhei monograph series and the architect of Category τ. With a background in mathematics and over two decades in technology leadership, he returned to the foundational question — *what if reality is more deeply coherent than it first appears?* — and spent years developing the kernel, the proofs, the inter-book structure, and the formal verification layer through TauLib. He presents the work not as a finished final word, but as a research architecture published for scrutiny.

**Anna-Sophie Fuchs** is co-author of the series and co-developer of the research program's public engagement surfaces, guided tour architecture, and editorial structure. With a background in archaeology, she brings a distinctive perspective — layered structures, fragile connections, reconstruction from fragments — to a program that requires exactly those sensibilities. She is also the collaboration's first skeptical reader, pressing every large claim to justify not only its ambition, but also its language, scope, tone, and relation to human reality.

Editorial-quality author headshots are available on request — see [Journalist FAQ → headshots and brand assets]({{ '/media/journalist-faq/' | relative_url }}#are-headshots-and-brand-assets-available) or write directly to [press@panta-rhei.site](mailto:press@panta-rhei.site).

### Scientific plates — visual atlas

The program publishes a series of **scientific plates** — editorial-quality structural maps that compress key arguments into single-frame, scan-readable visuals. The full atlas (currently {{ site.data.plates | size }} plates, all CC BY 4.0) lives at [`/media/posters/`]({{ '/media/posters/' | relative_url }}), each with a print-quality 1536 × 864 master JPG suitable for editorial layouts, conference talks, slide decks, and printed handouts. A machine-readable index for cross-site embedding is published at [`/api/plates.json`]({{ '/api/plates.json' | relative_url }}) (CORS-permissive).
