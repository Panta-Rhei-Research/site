## About the Program

The Panta Rhei Research Program is an independent open research program developing **Category τ** — a categorical framework built from five generators, seven axioms, and one operator that derives results across mathematics, physics, biology, and philosophy from a single coherence kernel.

{% assign book_count = site.data.publications.books | size %}{% assign result_count = site.data.results.results | size %}{% assign registry_count = site.data.registry.objects | size %}{% assign chapter_count = site.data.publications.chapters | size %}The program's canonical release (April 2026) includes:
- A **{{ book_count }}-book monograph series** (~3,430 pages, available on Amazon KDP)
- A **Lean 4 formalization library** (TauLib, 458 modules, 0 sorry across all 7 books)

## Press Kit

### Program Boilerplate (copy-paste ready)

The Panta Rhei Research Program develops Category τ, a categorical framework that derives results across mathematics, physics, biology, and philosophy from five generators, seven axioms, and one operator. The program's seven-book monograph series (2nd Edition, April 2026) is accompanied by a Lean 4 formalization library, {{ result_count }} key results with typed epistemic status, and a public research website with {{ registry_count }} registry objects. All claims carry explicit scope labels and verification routes. The program is independent research — not yet peer-reviewed in traditional journals.

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Books | {{ book_count }} |
| Total pages | ~3,430 |
| Chapters | {{ chapter_count }} |
| Key results | {{ result_count }} |
| Registry objects | {{ registry_count }} |
| Lean 4 modules | 450 |
| Lines of Lean 4 | 127,440 |
| Machine-checked theorems | 4,332 |
| Sorry (unproven) | 3 (Book VII only) |
| Free parameters | 0 |
| Quantitative predictions | 220+ |

### Author Bios

**Dr. Thorsten Fuchs** is the principal author of the Panta Rhei monograph series and the architect of Category τ. With a background in mathematics and over two decades in technology leadership, he returned to the foundational question — *what if reality is more deeply coherent than it first appears?* — and spent years developing the kernel, the proofs, the inter-book structure, and the formal verification layer through TauLib. He presents the work not as a finished final word, but as a research architecture published for scrutiny.

**Anna-Sophie Fuchs** is co-author of the series and co-developer of the research program's public engagement surfaces, guided tour architecture, and editorial structure. With a background in archaeology, she brings a distinctive perspective — layered structures, fragile connections, reconstruction from fragments — to a program that requires exactly those sensibilities. She is also the collaboration's first skeptical reader, pressing every large claim to justify not only its ambition, but also its language, scope, tone, and relation to human reality.
