# Tour 02: The Central Theorem


A guided walk through the climax of Book II:

**O(tau^3) = A_spec(L)**

The ring of tau-holomorphic functions on the fibered product tau^3 is
canonically isomorphic to the spectral algebra of the lemniscate L.

This tour covers:

- The split-complex boundary ring H = Z[j] and its sector decomposition

- The tau^3 fibered product: base tau^1, fiber T^2, and why it is NOT a product

- Boundary characters: idempotent-supported maps from the profinite boundary

- The Central Theorem itself: all four links of the isomorphism

- Spectral ring and holographic principle


**Prerequisites:** Tour/Foundations.lean (generators, axioms, iota_tau).
