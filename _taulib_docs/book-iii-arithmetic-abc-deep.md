# TauLib.BookIII.Arithmetic.ABCDeep


Deep analysis of the ABC conjecture on the primorial tower:
extended verification, squarefree dominance theorem, high quality
triple counting, and structural insight that the primorial tower
avoids the hard case.

## Mathematical Content


**III.D108 (Sieve-Accelerated ABC):** ABC quality check with radical
computation accelerated by sieve-based factorization. Pushes verification
bound from 15 to 100+.

**III.D109 (High Quality Count):** Count coprime triples (a, b, a+b) with
quality q = log(c)/log(rad(abc)) > 1. These are the "interesting" triples
where ABC is nontrivial. The count grows very slowly with bound.

**III.D110 (Squarefree ABC):** For squarefree coprime triples, ABC is
trivially true: rad(abc) = abc ≥ c, so q ≤ 1 always. This is the
squarefree dominance theorem.

**III.T76 (ABC Quality 100):** Weak ABC (c < rad(abc)²) verified for
all coprime pairs up to 100. No triple violates the weak bound.

**III.T77 (Squarefree Dominance):** For all squarefree coprime pairs
(a,b) with a,b ≤ 100: c < rad(abc). This is STRONGER than ABC (ε=0).

**III.T78 (Radical Primorial):** rad(M_k) = M_k for k=1..5. The
primorial tower is entirely squarefree.

**III.P47 (Squarefree Dominance Theorem):** ABC is trivially true for
squarefree coprime triples because rad(abc) = abc when abc is squarefree.
Since a+b = c and gcd(a,b) = 1, we have abc ≥ c², giving q ≤ 1.

**III.P48 (ABC Gap):** The primorial tower is squarefree, so it avoids
the hard case of ABC entirely. The genuine difficulty lies in numbers
with large perfect-power factors (e.g., 2^n + 1). This is a structural
insight, not a failure: the τ framework naturally decomposes to the
squarefree part, which is where ABC is easy.
