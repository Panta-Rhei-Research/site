# TauLib.Sets.Counting


Generative counting: the bijection that simultaneously creates and enumerates
orbit elements, and countability of Obj(tau) as a structural consequence.

## Registry Cross-References


- [I.D75] Generative Counting Principle -- `generative_counting_principle`

- [I.P33] Counting as Structural Feature -- `counting_structural`


## Ground Truth Sources


- Part IX "The Cantor Mirage": Countability is earned via orbit generation,
not imposed by external cardinality axioms.


## Mathematical Content


The Generative Counting Principle states that the bijection phi_g(n) = rho^n(g)
simultaneously CREATES each orbit element and ASSIGNS it a natural-number label.
There is no prior pool of uncounted objects -- every object arrives already
counted by virtue of its generation depth.

From this principle plus the Ontic Closure Theorem (K6), countability of Obj(tau)
follows: the universe is a finite union of countably generated orbit rays plus
the singleton {omega}. No uncountable structure can arise without three
prerequisites that are absent from K0--K6:

- Impredicative powerset (collecting ALL subsets of an infinite set)

- Unrestricted comprehension (Sep : (Idx -> Prop) -> Idx)

- Free Cartesian diagonal (Delta : Idx -> Idx x Idx as an earned morphism)


All three are blocked by the earned-arrow discipline.

[I.D75] The generative counting principle: the map phi_g(n) = (g, n)
simultaneously creates the n-th orbit element and assigns it index n.
This is a bijection between Nat and the orbit ray O_g.

- phi : ℕ → Kernel.TauObj
The creation-enumeration map: n maps to the n-th orbit element

- phi_def
(n : ℕ)
 : self.phi n = { seed := g, depth := n }
phi is defined as depth-n in orbit g

- phi_injective
(n m : ℕ)
 : self.phi n = self.phi m → n = m
phi is injective (distinct depths yield distinct objects)

- phi_surjective
(x : Kernel.TauObj)
 : Orbit.OrbitRay g x → ∃ (n : ℕ), self.phi n = x
phi is surjective onto O_g (every orbit element has a depth)

[I.P33] Countability of Obj(tau) as a structural feature:
it follows from generative counting (each orbit is counted)
plus ontic closure (the universe is a finite union of orbits).

The injection TauObj -> Nat witnesses countability.

Tau.Sets.obj_tau_countable :(∃ (f : Kernel.TauObj → ℕ), Function.Injective f) ∧ ∃ (g : ℕ → Kernel.TauObj), Function.Injective g**


|Obj(tau)| = aleph_0: the object universe is countably infinite.
Injective: tauObj_encode provides an injection TauObj -> Nat.
Surjective: the alpha orbit maps Nat into TauObj injectively.

**structure
Tau.Sets.UncountablePrerequisites :Type**


An uncountability argument requires three structural prerequisites.
This record witnesses the absence of each from K0-K6.

- no_impredicative_powerset : Prop
P1: Impredicative powerset -- would require collecting ALL subsets
of an infinite set, but tau-sets are divisor sets (always finite for
nonzero indices).

- no_comprehension : Prop
P2: Unrestricted comprehension -- would require
Sep : (TauIdx -> Prop) -> TauIdx, but no such separator exists.

- no_free_diagonal : Prop
P3: Free Cartesian diagonal -- would require
Delta : TauIdx -> TauIdx x TauIdx as an earned morphism,
but self-pairing is not in the program monoid.

### `Tau.Sets.no_uncountable_prerequisite`

[source](https://github.com/ThorFuchs/PantaRhei-2ndEd/blob/87ff63f4499acab4176a3022155d2ef1751f3e06/lean4/TauLib/TauLib/BookI/Sets/Counting.lean#L127-L151)
**def
Tau.Sets.no_uncountable_prerequisite :UncountablePrerequisites**


The three prerequisites for uncountability are not derivable from K0-K6.

P1 (impredicative powerset): For any nonzero b, the tau-members of b
are bounded by b (tau_mem_le), so the "powerset" at each level is finite.
There is no single tau-index encoding "all subsets of Nat."

P2 (unrestricted comprehension): The tau-set universe is exactly Nat;
not every predicate on Nat corresponds to a tau-index. In particular,
there is no R such that a in_tau R iff not(a in_tau a) (no_russell_set).

P3 (free Cartesian diagonal): Self-pairing n |-> (n, n) requires a
product encoding that is an earned morphism. But in Cat_tau (thin category),
the diagonal map would need to factor through the product universal
property, and the earned-arrow discipline prevents unrestricted self-reference.
