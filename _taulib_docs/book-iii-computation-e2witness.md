# TauLib.BookIII.Computation.E2Witness


Constructive E₂ operational closure witnesses: Kleene fixed points,
orbit diversity, and strict enrichment beyond E₁.

## Registry Cross-References


- [III.D83] Kleene Fixed Point — `kleene_fixed_point`, `kleene_check`

- [III.D84] E₂ Orbit Structure — `orbit_length`, `orbit_diversity_check`

- [III.T57] Operational Closure — `operational_closure_full_check`

- [III.P34] E₂ ⊋ E₁ Strict Witness — `e2_strict_witness_check`


## Mathematical Content


**III.D83 (Kleene Fixed Point):** At stage k, define the self-application
operator S(c) = D(c, c) where D is the code-decode map. A fixed point is
c* such that S(c*) = c*. At every finite stage, fixed points exist because
the map Z/M_k Z → Z/M_k Z is on a finite set.

**III.D84 (E₂ Orbit Structure):** The orbit of code c under the decode map
D: x ↦ (x + d) mod M_k has length dividing M_k. Orbit lengths exhibit
diversity: not all orbits have the same length, proving computational
richness (contrast with E₁ where all orbits are trivially periodic).

**III.T57 (Operational Closure):** Every E₂-admissible operation (code-decode
cycle) stays within E₂: the output is a valid E₂ carrier element at the
same or lower stage. This is the computational analog of holomorphic closure.

**III.P34 (E₂ ⊋ E₁ Strict Witness):** E₂ contains code-decode structures
that cannot be expressed as pure sector decompositions (E₁ content). The
witness is an orbit with length > 2 (E₁ orbits have length ≤ 2 due to
bipolar e₊/e₋ involution).
