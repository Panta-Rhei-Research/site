# AI-Assisted Discovery

This page provides copy-ready prompts for visitors who want to use a web-enabled frontier LLM to generate a first-pass outside-in assessment of the Panta Rhei Research Program.

These prompts are discovery aids.

They are not peer review, formal verification, empirical validation, or endorsement.

Use them to orient yourself, generate questions, find the right pages, and decide which inspection route to follow next.

> **AI-assisted discovery is orientation, not verification.**

## How to use these prompts

1. Copy a prompt.
2. Paste it into a frontier LLM with web browsing enabled.
3. Ask the model to use only public pages from `panta-rhei.site`, public GitHub repositories, and public artifacts.
4. Require citations or source links.
5. Treat the output as a first-pass orientation report, not as verification.

For formal, empirical, or technical inspection, continue to [Verify]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}) and [Assessment Protocols]({{ '/verify/assessment-protocols/' | relative_url }}).

## What AI-assisted discovery can and cannot do

**AI-assisted discovery can help:**

- summarize the site;
- identify the main claims and routes;
- produce a first-contact seriousness assessment;
- compare lanes;
- generate questions;
- find inspection surfaces;
- prepare a journalist or reviewer briefing.

**AI-assisted discovery cannot:**

- verify the theory;
- replace peer review;
- certify formal proof;
- validate empirical predictions;
- establish priority or novelty;
- determine scientific acceptance.

> **LLM outputs can be wrong.** Use them to find pages, generate questions, and route inspection. Continue to Verify for actual verification paths.

## Prompt catalog

Ten copy-ready prompts. Use the one that matches your intent. Then route the LLM's output back into the relevant lane — Program, Agenda, Corpus, Results, Verify, or Engage.

---

### <a id="prompt-1"></a>Prompt 1 — 90-second first-contact assessment

**Purpose.** Quickly decide whether the site appears serious enough to inspect.

**Best for.** Journalists, editors, first-time visitors, link-from-a-trusted-source readers.

{% include copy-prompt-button.html id="first-contact" %}

```text
You are an expert science journalist receiving a link from a trusted source. Perform a 90-second first-contact assessment of https://panta-rhei.site.

Use only public web pages and cite the pages you rely on.

Your task is not to decide whether the framework is true. Your task is to answer:

1. What is this site?
2. What does the program claim to be building?
3. Does the site appear to expose enough structure to be worth a deeper look?
4. What are the most important first-contact credibility signals?
5. What are the most important first-contact risk signals?
6. Which three pages should I inspect next?

Output format:
- Executive verdict in 5 sentences.
- Credibility signals.
- Risk signals.
- Recommended next clicks.
- One-sentence newsroom pitch.
```

**Next route.** [Media Kit]({{ '/media/' | relative_url }}) → [Open Research Brief]({{ '/media/open-research-brief/' | relative_url }}) → [Program]({{ '/program/' | relative_url }}) → [Verify]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}).

### Prompt 2 — Research-form legitimacy dossier

**Purpose.** Assess whether the public artifact is serious, inspectable, and review-worthy.

**Best for.** Reviewers, foundation officers, prospective collaborators, evaluators of high-scope open research.

{% include copy-prompt-button.html id="legitimacy-dossier" %}

```text
You are conducting an AI-assisted first-pass assessment of a public research architecture.

Use only public materials from https://panta-rhei.site and public repositories linked from that site.

Do not decide whether the framework is true.

Produce a typed dossier answering:

1. Research-form legitimacy:
   Does this work appear to be a serious, inspectable, review-worthy research artifact?

2. Novelty and relevance:
   If yes, do its claims appear potentially novel and materially relevant relative to mainstream frontier work in the domains it addresses?

3. Impact and salvage value:
   If the core claims held, what would the likely magnitude of contribution be?
   If the core claims partly failed, what might still remain scientifically, formally, educationally, or methodologically valuable?

Requirements:
- Cite every public page used.
- Distinguish internal program claims from external verification.
- Identify at least five inspection surfaces.
- Identify at least five overclaiming or risk areas.
- Provide a final recommendation: ignore, monitor, inspect narrowly, or prioritize expert review.
```

Use only public pages from the site and public repositories linked from it. Cite every page you rely on.

My questions are:

1. [INSERT QUESTION 1]
2. [INSERT QUESTION 2]
3. [INSERT QUESTION 3]

For each question:
- answer from the public site;
- identify which lane owns the relevant content;
- distinguish internal program stance from external verification;
- identify the best next pages to inspect;
- state what remains unresolved.

Then summarize whether my questions are best pursued through Program, Agenda, Corpus, Results, Verify, Impact, or Engage.
```

## Locked language

> AI-assisted discovery is orientation, not verification.

> Use these prompts to find pages, generate questions, and choose inspection routes.

> LLM outputs can be wrong; continue to Verify for actual verification paths.

> Core Semantics is the language the theory must earn before it can answer.

> Agenda states obligations. Corpus builds. Results reports consequences. Verify inspects.

> Engagement and review do not require endorsement.

## What to do with the output

After running a prompt, the report is your starting point — not your conclusion.

- For **journalist briefings**, route through [Media Kit]({{ '/media/' | relative_url }}).
- For **technical inspection**, continue to [Verify]({{ '/verify/' | relative_url }}) and [Assessment Protocols]({{ '/verify/assessment-protocols/' | relative_url }}).
- For **review and correction**, use [Engage: Review the Work]({{ '/engage/review-the-work/' | relative_url }}).
- For **claims about results or predictions**, use [Results]({{ '/results/' | relative_url }}) and the falsification ledger.
- For **conceptual orientation**, use [Program]({{ '/program/about/coherent-theory-of-reality/' | relative_url }}) and [Agenda]({{ '/agenda/' | relative_url }}).

These prompts are discovery aids. They are not peer review, formal verification, empirical validation, novelty proof, priority proof, or endorsement.
