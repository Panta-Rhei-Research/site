## Two Ongoing Streams

The site has two different public update streams.

### Research Notes

[Research Notes]({{ '/publications/research-notes/' | relative_url }}) are outward-facing, dated research artifacts. They are not blog posts and not changelog entries. They belong canonically to Publications, but Discover and Engage route readers toward them.

### Changelog

[Changelog]({{ '/changelog/' | relative_url }}) tracks changes to the site, corpus, release state, and infrastructure. It is supporting research infrastructure, not a publication stream.

## Subscribe

For email delivery of new Research Notes, use [Engage: Follow the Research]({{ '/engage/follow-the-research/' | relative_url }}).

Research Notes may comment on new developments in Core Semantics, the Structural Challenge Ledger, Construction Spine, Results, or Verify. White papers and media briefs are released under Publications; Research Notes are the ongoing dated scholarly stream.

## Recent Research Notes

{% assign notes = site.research_notes | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
{% for note in notes limit: 4 %}
<div class="v2-tile">
  <h3><a href="{{ note.url | relative_url }}">{{ note.title }}</a></h3>
  <p>{{ note.summary_short | default: note.summary_medium }}</p>
  <div class="v2-badge-row">
    <span class="v2-badge">{{ note.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}</span>
    {% if note.note_type %}<span class="v2-badge">{{ note.note_type }}</span>{% endif %}
  </div>
</div>
{% endfor %}
